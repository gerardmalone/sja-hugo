**Message from Father Peter:**  
This Friday we celebrate the Lancaster Diocesan Celebration of the Memorial of Our Lady of Fernyhalgh at Ladyewell, just North of Preston, off the A6 at Broughton – our Southern Diocesan Shrine to Our Blessed Mother Mary (the Northernmost one being Cleator in West Cumbria, my home Parish). Fernyhalgh has been a place of devotion to Mary for Centuries – records going right back to the 11th Century, indeed the name ‘Fernyhalgh’ has been taken to mean ‘Ancient Shrine’ by some historians, although there other somewhat more prosaic explanations for the name, and prayer has been offered their continually, right up to events that take place their now, even during times of persecution. The name ‘Ladyewell’ seems to have been given to the place from the mid 1600’s, when the present house there was built, with the well developed by nuns living there at the beginning of the twentieth century – there is a legend of an Irish Sailor being directed in a dream to the well and to build a chapel after surviving a storm at sea. As well as a place of devotion to Mary, the site now houses a chapel which recalls all the names of the Diocesan Martyrs, reminding us of the great faith that has persisted through thick and thin in this part of Northen England. There are many events and personal pilgrimages throughout the year – with other Christian denominations praying there too. Almighty God, the legend of the well has carried over the centuries devotion to our Lady of Fernyhalgh, even when to be faithful was a call to martyrdom. May we today confront the most subtle challenges of the world to our faith as we renew our prayer for your protection, through the intercession of Mary, Mother of your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with your and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and veer. Amen. If you haven’t been, do pop in if you are able, or checkout their website – and perhaps we might think about our own Parishes Pilgrimage over there ourselves? It’s a lot nearer than Guadalupe!  

**Bishop Paul:**  
Bishop Paul thoroughly enjoyed his time here last week, and has promised to write a letter thanking everyone for their welcome and hospitality on his unannounced visit! Watch this space.  

**Masses with our Young People:**  
Over the past couple of weeks we celebrated two wonderful Masses with our young people – a celebration of First Communion with all the Year Fours from our five deanery schools, and a Mass led by St. Bede’s last Tuesday. Many thanks to everyone who helped organise these celebrations, and all who work so hard to pass on the faith to our young people. Here’s to many more such celebrations!
