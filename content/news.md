**Message from Father Peter:**  
Last week I turned fifty-six years old (yes, I know it is hard to be believe but I am that young/old (delete as you feel is appropriate)). My usual 'Bingo Call' for the number 56 is 'The Hungarian uprising of Budapest', which itself is a personal reference to the musical 'Chess' which has a chorus of '1956 Budapest is Rising' (Don't ask about the plot, it's too convoluted to explain here). Anyway, I've been thinking about the Biblical implication of the number 56. The 56th book of the Bible (discounting the Deutero-canonical books) is St. Paul's Letter to Titus, a friend of Paul who had travelled with him and Barnabus to Jerusalem, and whom Paul left in charge of the community in Crete, and wrote to him about the duties of Priests and Bishops. In the year 56AD St. Paul was residing with the community in Ephesus, until he was drummed out of the city the following year. The year after that, AD58 Paul himself celebrated his 56th Birthday, a year which included him raising a man from the dead who had fallen whilst drifting off during one of Paul's all-night sermons (and you think my sermons are long). The word 'Honey' is found 56 times in the Bible. The beautiful Psalm 56 was written by King David before he was anointed King of Israel. The Psalm is a hymn of Praise thanking God for the support God has given David in his travels, and who, even when he is attacked by people on all sides, prays 'I will not be afraid, for what can man to do me? In the Lord I have put my trust', which isn't a bad thing to pray on your fifty-sixth birthday or any birthday come to that. Incidentally, I've decided that age is not going to get me down – it's far too difficult to get up again… I'll get my coat. And my zimmer frame…
