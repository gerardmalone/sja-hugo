**Message from Father Peter:**  
Well, it's only February but already the Sacramental Wheels of the Church have been busily spinning at SJSP's. It was a wonderful occasion on Monday evening when, with the Bishop, we celebrated our Confirmation mass, with our Candidates and friends and families. We now gear up for the beginning for the Course for First Reconciliation and Holy Communion, which will take us right up through the Candidates leading Mass on Maundy Thursday during the Easter Triduum at SJ's, to their celebration at SP's on Saturday May 10th, followed by Processions in Honour of Our Lady, led by the First Communicants in both Churches on Sunday May 11th. We also continue Journeys of Faith with several adults who are seeking reception into the Church at our Easter Celebrations, and who will be presented to the Bishop at the Rite of Election on March 8th at Lancaster Cathedral. Coupled with ongoing preparation for Baptisms, several Weddings dotted throughout the year, as well as our Monthly Mass and Anointing of the Sick, along with our usual times for Confession, with extra times during Lent, not least a Reconciliation Service in union with our friends at Star of the Sea, at SJ's on Thursday 7th April, prior to our Holy Week celebrations. How blessed we are to have Seven Beautiful Sacraments to help us to draw closer to Christ – and how blessed we are to have so many opportunities to celebrate them. Incidentally, what is a Dentist's favourite hymn? Crown him with many crowns. I'll get me coat. And my toothbrush.  

**This Week's Liturgical Calendar:**  
17th The Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order, seven men from Florence who founded a religious community in the 1300s; 21st St. Peter Damian (my name saint) an Italian of the 1000,s who wrote the first biography of St. George; 22nd The Chair of St. Peter the Apostle, a celebration of our unity under the Papacy of St. Peter and his successors.  

**Confirmation 2025:**  
Congratulations to our Candidates and huge thanks to their parents, teachers, our catechists, the Bishop and everyone who helped make the evening such a wonderful celebration.  

**First Reconciliation and Holy Communion:**  
Application forms are available from Father Peter after Masses. Please pray for our candidates as they continue their journeys of faith.  

**Trinity Hospice:**  
We are delighted to announce that we collected £1,094.61 for Trinity Hospice after masses last weekend. We would like to say a sincere 'Thank You' to everyone who has donated to our 2025 Appeal up to this point. We will be collecting again after the masses this weekend and our 'Just Giving' page will continue to accept donations – large or small – throughout the month of February 2025. Up to now, an additional £400.00 (including gift aid) has been donated this way. This page can be found at [www.justgiving.com/page/dennis-duignan-10](https://www.justgiving.com/page/dennis-duignan-10). Trinity Hospice needs £13m each year to provide their services. Please donate to this worthy cause if you can. Taxpayers can choose to add Gift Aid to the value of their donation. All monies raised go directly to Trinity Hospice. If you have any questions, please contact Dennis Duignan (number in this weeks [bulletin](/bulletins)).  

**Refurbishment of Bell Ringing Ropes:**  
In order to keep our wonderful bells ringing, in March we will be sending our ropes to Ellis' in Loughborough to have part of the rope replaced with polyhemp. The benefits of this include good resistance to abrasion and rotting. This work has recently become necessary due to some our ropes snapping and showing significant signs of wear. If you would like to contribute towards the cost of this work, ropes are available for sponsorship, the cost being £50 per rope. A record of the dedication would be displayed within the ringing room. Please contact James and Stacey (number in this weeks [bulletin](/bulletins)). Thank you.

**Lourdes:**  
there's been some positive reaction to the suggestion SJSP's might have a mini Pilgrimage to Lourdes this Summer. Four nights 3rd-7th June, £650 sharing, £749 single. Forms will be available from FrP and Deacon D next weekend if anyone would like to come along! Our Lady of Lourdes, Pray for us.
