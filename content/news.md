**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
So as we begin celebrating this New Year in the life of the Church, so we begin, this Monday, celebrating the life of Our Lady, Feasts of whom joyfully take us through the year, right up to her Glorious Assumption and Crowning as Queen of Heaven. And we begin celebrating the life of our Lady indeed from it’s very beginning with the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, the doctrine, promulgated only in 1854 by Pope Pius IX, though spoken of from earliest times, and theologically widely discussed in the Middle Ages, and possibly even referenced by the Angel Gabriel who greeted Mary as 'Full of Grace', that Mary was conceived without the stain of Original Sin. This was granted to Mary through the grace her Son won for us on the cross, and is known as 'prevenient grace' as it was given to Mary before the event of the crucifixion in time, an incredibly honour for Mary, and demonstrating to us how much our salvation is always at the heart of God's plan for us. The whole of Advent is about the beginnings of our Salvation, from the prophecies of Isaiah about the coming Messiah who was prepared to be a Suffering Servant on the cross for us, to the moment of the Annunciation when Mary consented to being the Servant of the Lord, through to the birth of Jesus itself, the life that would change our lives. Mary's Immaculate Conception shows to us how God can supernaturally make everything perfect for the birth of His Son, this assuring our salvation. How wonderful for us, and for Mary on this great feast. Mass for the Feast on Monday is at SP's at 9am, and we have Vespers of the Feast at SJ's on Monday evening. This is the opening prayer for Mass on Monday, which beautifully explains to us in the form of prayer this beautiful teaching. O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin prepared a worthy dwelling for your Son, grant, we pray, that, as you preserved her from every stain by virtue of the Death of your Son, which you foresaw, so, through her intercession, we, too, may be cleansed and admitted to your presence. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever.

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.  

**Email Address:**  
The Diocese is changing all email addresses. The one email for our two parishes is now [sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk](mailto:sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk). Please do whatever you have to do to use this email from now on. Cheers.

Please let us know and we can contact them. Or you can give them our St Joseph’s Care phone number so they can contact us: Tel: 07840112265.
