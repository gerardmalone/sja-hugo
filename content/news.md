**Message from Father Peter:**  
'Do whatever he tells you' are the words of Mary to the Servants at the Wedding in Cana in this Sunday's Gospel. There are so many beautiful prayers in which we invoke the prayer and support of Mary. As England is traditionally known as the 'dowry of Mary' we are privileged to pray the 'Hail Mary' at every Mass at the end of the Bidding Prayers, and both of our Churches now pray 'The Angelus' before our weekday Masses. But I thought I should add to our Marian Prayers, by just focusing on the 'Hail, Holy Queen' or the 'Salve Regina' as it is known by its Latin title. This prayer is frequently used in the recitation of the Holy Rosary, as well as being one of the four Marian Anthems which is traditional said at the end of Night Prayer. The Prayer was composed and became popular in monasteries (and, intriguingly, among sailors) in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The prayer asks us to look at the world through the eyes of Mary, particularly noting the sorrows we experience as part of fallen humanity – remembering the sorrows Mary herself experienced at the death of her Son, as foretold by the prophet Simeon at the Presentation of the Lord on his eighth day. But the prayer is joyful and hopeful about how Mary can show us in her Son, Jesus, the answer to all our prayers – as Mary did throughout her life from the moment of His conception. Perhaps we could follow the tradition of the Church and make this prayer part of our own nightly routine. *Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, O most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Incidentally, talking of nightly routines, A man is arrested late at night for drinking coffee... He was charged for resisting a rest. I'll get my coat. And my latte. Decaff.*

**Prayer for Christian Unity:**  
O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only Saviour, the Prince of Peace: Give us grace seriously to lay to heart the great dangers we are in by our unhappy divisions. Take away all hatred and prejudice, and whatsoever else may hinder us from godly union and concord: that, as there is but one Body, and one Spirit, and one hope of our calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all; so we may henceforth be all of one heart, and of one soul, united in one holy bond of truth and peace, of faith and charity, and with one mind and one mouth glorify thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
