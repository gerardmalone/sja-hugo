**Message from Father Peter:**  
A couple of weeks ago the new Translation of the Scriptures, when speaking of the Call of the first Apostles, had the Lord tell Peter that from now on he would 'catch men', which isn't too different from the previous Jerusalem translation 'catch people' (although less politically correct), and is somewhat wayward from the more poetic 'fishers of men' which, somewhat confusingly (for me anyway), was still the translation used in the Gospel Acclamation verse, sung by me at all masses! So how are you finding the New Translation? I'm generally ok with it, though I find some parts of it somewhat ungainly, and it can be difficult to read when you are used to a certain old phrase or a different order of words. (Incidentally I find the way it is laid out in the Lectionaries, verse by verse, sometimes difficult, as you think you've finished a sentence, and it continues on the next line). There is also the complexity of using 'old' missals and mass books with the previous translation. To aid this, the response to the psalm is always at the top of the newsletter (on this side, see above). Translations are freely downloadable from the internet at 'Universalis' usually a few days before, and there is always the 'app' for phones and tablets from 'Universalis', which, although expensive for an app, is much cheaper than a missal. You may see people reading their phones during the Liturgy of the Word – don't condemn them: they're following the Scriptures! Whether at SJ's the books should be wholly replaced or alternatively at both Churches we go on to weekly missalettes is something to think about, so if you have any strong views, please speak to me! Any ways or means to help us love, learn, know and understand the Scriptures is a good thing. Incidentally, did you hear about the guy who believed only 12.5% of the Bible? He was an eighth-theist. I'll get my coat. And my lectionary…

**This Week's Liturgical Calendar:**

**Refurbishment of Bell Ringing Ropes:**  
In order to keep our wonderful bells ringing, in March we will be sending our ropes to Ellis' in Loughborough to have part of the rope replaced with polyhemp. The benefits of this include good resistance to abrasion and rotting. This work has recently become necessary due to some our ropes snapping and showing significant signs of wear. If you would like to contribute towards the cost of this work, ropes are available for sponsorship, the cost being £50 per rope. A record of the dedication would be displayed within the ringing room. Please contact James and Stacey (number in this weeks [bulletin](/bulletins)). Thank you.
