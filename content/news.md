**Message from Father Peter:**  
So last week we celebrated the memorial of the Holy Family of Bethany, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, and a couple of weeks ago the Sunday Gospel was about Mary and Martha, with Martha bustling in the kitchen whilst Mary listened to the Jesus. I mentioned that it was because Mary listened to the voice of the Lord that Mary recognised Jesus on Easter Sunday when he called her name at his resurrection. But that wasn’t necessarily correct, and this is the theological can of hornets which I alluded to in last week’s bulletin message. For a couple of thousand years, the Church, or rather the Church in Western Europe, has considered Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene to be the same person - as well as this one Mary being the person who anointed Jesus in Holy Week, which in John’s Gospel is definitely Mary of Bethany, in Mark and Matthew is an unnamed woman, and in Luke is a sinful woman who anoints Jesus but not in Bethany, and much earlier than Holy Week - though there are some scriptural suggestions that Jesus was anointed more than once. In Eastern Christianity, and adopted by some non-Catholic Christians from the birth of Protestantism, the Marys were always considered to be two different people, but in the West, we only had one liturgical celebration for Mary Magdalene on July 22nd, and Martha, without her brother and sister, having a celebration on July 29th. Scriptural scholars have had a field day with all of this - apparently the French in particular prefer to see her as one person, and indeed various traditions tell of the one, or the two, Mary’s living out her final days in France (remember the nonsense that was ‘The Da Vinci Code’?). I don’t know what shenanigans went on in the Vatican, but in 1969 Mary of Bethany was separated liturgically from Mary of Magdala, and it was only in 2021 that July 29th was given over to Martha and Mary and Lazarus. Either way, we have the example of a Mary who listened to the teaching of Jesus when the time was appropriate, and a Mary who, having being forgiven for much in her life, was granted the amazing privilege of being a witness to the resurrection and the first charged with telling others about this incredible event. Of course don’t forget, there is also Mary, wife of Clopas (possibly a brother of St. Joseph), who is present at the crucifixion. And not forgetting our own Blessed Mother Mary. I’m sure we can’t go wrong seeking the intercession of any, or indeed all, of these amazing women called Mary, a name which means ‘beloved’. From the Common of Holy Women: Lord, pour upon us the spirit of wisdom and love with which you filled the Holy Women of the Scriptures. By serving you as they did, may we please you by our faith and our actions. Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.
