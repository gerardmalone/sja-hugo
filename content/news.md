**Message from Father Peter:**  
If you peruse the Arts pages of the newspapers (or the Arts pages of the Newspapers on the Internet, as I do), you’ll know there has been a new production of ‘Evita’ at the Palladium in London (which a parishioner at SP’s attended last week - huge thanks for the mug to add to my collection!). The ‘Opera’ (as it calls itself) begins with a setting of the Salve Regina (sung at the Requiem of Eva Peron), otherwise known in English as the ‘Hail, Holy Queen’, one of the four Marian Hymns which we sing at the end of Compline, the Night Prayer of the Church - we also traditionally recite it towards the end of the Rosary. The Prayer was composed during the Middle Ages and spread throughout Europe via various Monasteries and religious communities, and by the nineteenth century was a common prayer of the Church. The Prayer addresses Mary as a model of humanity, to whom we can identify, as ‘children of Eve’, and acknowledges that while there are difficulties and sorrows in this world, bringing forth tears and sighs - our own and those of others for whom we pray - we ask Mary to lead us in our fallen humanity to the fruit of her womb, Jesus our Saviour. The Month of September is traditionally dedicated to Mary, Mother of Sorrows, and with so many sorrows in this world, not least the anti-Catholic attack on children at Mass just two weeks ago, the prayer is more appropriate - and perhaps more necessary - than ever. Hail Holy Queen, Mother of mercy, Our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us. And after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement O loving O sweet Virgin Mary.

**Red Mission Boxes:**  
The Autumn collection from the boxes commences this week. Please would you bring your box to church and leave in the sacristy [make sure your name is on the box] The boxes will be returned to the sacristy after emptying. If you would like a box, please contact David Warwick.  

**The Church Grounds:**  
Fr. Peter has asked me to organise a group of willing volunteers to take care of the planted borders at St. Joseph’s. The lawns and hedging are looked after privately. If you are willing and able to help out for an hour or two each month - probably less over winter after an initial tidy up, then please email me at [pat52benning@gmail.com](pat52benning@gmail.com) As ever, the more people who can commit, the less onerous the workload. Once I have names and mobile numbers, I’ll organise a get together. We have a beautiful church, let’s keep the gardens beautiful too. Thank you in anticipation. Pat. (And thanks from FrP too).  

**Email Address:**  
The Diocese is changing all email addresses. The one email for our two parishes is now [sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk](mailto:sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk). Please do whatever you have to do to use this email from now on. Cheers.  

**Hospital:**  
Please remember to let us know if you or one of your family is being admitted to hospital.

**Coffee & Bacon Butties:**  
Will be available in the church hall after the 9:15am Mass. Why not come and enjoy a chat.

**St Joseph’s Care:**  
Do you know of anyone in our community who is in need or might need a little more support? Company or just someone to talk to? Someone who may, at times, need help with things? Please let us know and we can contact them. Or you can give them our St Joseph’s Care phone number so they can contact us: Tel: 07840112265.

**St Joseph’s Facebook Page:**  
We now have over 300 people regularly following us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Josephs-Roman-Catholic-Church-Ansdell/230000653837017) which is allowing us to reach out to those in the wider community and fulfill our parish commitment to evangelization. In the last couple of months, we have been able to help a number of people who have sought assistance through this medium.
