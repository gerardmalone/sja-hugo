**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
And a very Happy New Year to you all as we begin a new Year in the life of the Church. Today we begin the beautiful season of Advent – my favourite Season in the Year of the Church, yet one which is somewhat sadly always rushed, and one of the busiest, as we all run around preparing for Christmas, not always taking the time to pause and reflect about what we are truly preparing for. The readings for this season, both on Sundays and Weekdays really do draw us into the beauty of the four weeks, as we try to get into the spirit of the people of old awaiting the expected arrival of the Messiah. In this Year of Matthew, the Sunday Gospels will speak about the coming of the Son of Man, and his heralding by John the Baptist. For the first few weekdays we take on the spirit of the prophets who waited and longed for the Messiah, who would free them from evil and deliver them from their enemies. Then, in the middle of next week we look to the person of John the Baptist and his call to ‘Prepare ye the way of the Lord’, not least Christ’s own words about his elder cousin, until, finally, from December 17th we really begin the Christmas story delving into the heart and mind of our Blessed Mother Mary, as she looked forward to the birth of her Son, along with the other protagonists in the infancy narratives of Jesus. With such beautiful readings to help us at our Masses, along with our celebrations on Mondays of Evening Prayer, as well as our school carol services, and our own Children’s Nativity, let’s make this Season of Advent a real spiritual time of preparation – alongside our material preparations – so that in every way possible we are truly ready to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Here is a beautiful Advent Prayer by Henri Nouwen. *Lord Jesus, Master of both the light and the darkness, send your Holy Spirit upon our preparations for Christmas. We who have so much to do seek quiet spaces to hear your voice each day. We who are anxious over many things look forward to your coming among us. We who are blessed in so many ways long for the complete joy of your kingdom. We whose hearts are heavy seek the joy of your presence. We are your people, walking in darkness, yet seeking the light. To you we say, ‘Come Lord Jesus!’*

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
