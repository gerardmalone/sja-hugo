**Message from Father Peter:**  
Next weekend begins the month of November, traditionally the month when we pray especially for the Holy Souls, all those who have gone before us and a journeying to heaven, to be in the presence of the Godhead and our Blessed Mother Mary for eternity. There are many opportunities at SJSP’s to make this a special month, beginning with a Mass for the Holy Souls in the Cemetery chapel at Saltcotes on the Morning of Saturday 1st at 10am, after which it will be a privilege for me to bless any graves as families and friends say prayers. After celebrating All Saints on the Sunday, and continuing with our usual First Week events of Evening Prayer and First Friday, we are then taken to Remembrance Sunday, remembering all those who gave their lives defending freedom and justice in the World Wars especially. The Act of Remembrance will be made at all our weekend masses. The following Sunday I will read out the list of those whose funerals have been celebrated by SJSP’s over the past year, since last November. All the details of these celebrations, as well as other opportunities prayer are on the November Leaflet, which you are welcome to take – and perhaps pass on to others who make like to unite themselves with us by the presence or in their prayers. Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May they rest in peace. Amen, all for the greater honour and glory of God. Tender God of Mercy, You so loved us that You sent Your only Son, Jesus, to be our Redeemer. In Him we have come to know You and love You. As we draw closer to You, we seek to share the Good News of Your powerful life-giving Love. In this month of the Holy Souls, we pray for all the faithful departed, and especially for the relatives, friends, and neighbors who brightened our lives. Through the intercession of Mary, the Mother of God, I commend them to Your Divine Mercy. May they welcome these souls into Your heavenly garden. Tender God of Mercy, may these souls, all who sleep in Christ, and all who seek You with a sincere heart, find in Your Presence light, happiness, and peace. Lead them into the fullness of the resurrection and gladden them with the light of Your Face. Amen.  

**Fr. Peter Hart:**  
Please note that while Fr. Peter Hart is in Hospital and recovering from his Operation, I will be covering the 5pm Mass at Star of the Sea, so will not be around to welcome for the 6pm, and apologies for any breathlessness at the evening celebration!

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
