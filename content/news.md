**Message from Father Peter:**  
This week we resume our monthly Rosary and Benediction, on Third Tuesdays of each Month, alternating between our Churches (this Month, as you can see above it is at St. Peter’s). Every month this is a very special and beautiful hour. You might remember that we started the hour at a suggestion of some parishioners who wanted to pray the Rosary one evening, especially for peace in a world which is so indeed of prayers. Reciting the Mysteries together us a beautiful, prayerful action, gently and quietly allowing us to reflect on various aspects of the life of Christ, joyful, glorious, sorrowful or glorious, as seen through the eyes of our Blessed Mother Mary. We then move into Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament; an important time, as we are so used to receiving Holy Communion as most of our gatherings are for the Sacrifice of the Mass. Here we have some special time just to recognise the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and use this is short period of silence before our Lord for our own personal prayer – silence being something which is often lacking in our lives, our world, and sometimes, we might say, even in our liturgies. The ancient prayers of Benediction prepare us for the special Eucharistic Blessing, after which we say the Divine Praises – originally written at the end of the eighteenth century to ward off blasphemy, and added to since then with the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. We always conclude, as is traditional at the end of the day in the Church, with a hymn to Our Lady. This is truly a wondrous and very special time of grace for everyone, and all are warmly invited to come to the hour, or even just for a short time, to experience, share and pray for peace - of mind, heart, and soul - for ourselves and the world. This is Pope John XXIII’s Prayer for Peace: Lord Jesus Christ, who are called the Prince of Peace, who are yourself our peace and reconciliation, who so often said, ‘Peace to you,’ grant us peace. Make all men and women witnesses of truth, justice, and brotherly love. Banish from their hearts whatever might endanger peace. Enlighten our rulers that they may guarantee and defend the great gift of peace. May all peoples of the earth become as brothers and sisters. May longed-for peace blossom forth and reign always over us all. Amen.  

**Fr. Peter Foulkes:**  
it was with sadness that we announced the peaceful death fortified by the rites of Holy Mother Church, of our dear friend, Fr. Peter. May he rest deservedly in the peace and love of Christ. His funeral details will be announced soon. Please keep his brother Fr. John in your prayers at this time.

**The Lenten Houses.**  
In his Christmas message Fr. Steven Jerry Ochieng, MCSPA of the Missionary Community of St. Paul the Apostle wrote: Signs of God's Providence This year has brought other remarkable blessings too. Four houses for our brothers and sisters living with albinism now stand completed with three built with the help of Christians from St Joseph in Ansdell, St Peters in Lytham and St. Bernadette’s in Bispham in England, offering not just shelter but dignity, safety, and a tangible sign that they are valued members of our community. Each house represents a family no longer living in fear, children who can play freely, and parents who can rest peacefully. Many blessings to everyone who supported last year’s amazing Lenten project. And watch this space for details of FrP’s Lenten Project 2026!  

**SJSP Ukulele Orchestra:**

**Wednesday 21st January is the Memorial of St. Agnes.**  
When she was just twelve years of age St. Agnes suffered martyrdom at Rome, either in the second half of the third century or, more probably, at the beginning of the fourth century. Pope Damasus embellished her tomb with sacred verses, and many of the Fathers, including St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, spoke of her with great praise. She is mentioned in the Eucharistic Prayer I, and there is a statue of her in SJ’s. She is Patron Saint of Young Girls, and tradition has it that on the eve of her Feast you are likely to dream of the person you are to marry.
