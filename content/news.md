**Message from Father Peter:**  
In today's Second Reading, St. Paul uses the phrase 'Fight the Good Fight' when looking back on his life: 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race', and it's a phrase he uses at other times in his Letters, too, such as in 1 Timothy 6:12 'Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.' 'Fight the good fight' is one of those phrases which lots of people might use, but not everyone would know it was from the Bible. Here's a few more well-known phrases and their Biblical Origins:  
'Go the Extra Mile': Matthew 5:41 'And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.'  
'Give Up the Ghost': John 19:30 'When Jesus had therefore received the vinegar, He said 'It is finished:' and He bowed His head and gave up the ghost.' As an act of will, in accordance with the Father's will, Jesus committed His Spirit to His Father. Why we now use 'Spirit' as our translation instead of 'Ghost' is worthy of a whole Message in itself….  
'The Powers That Be'; Romans 13:1 'Let every soul subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be are ordained by God.'  
'Fall By the Wayside': Luke 8:5 'A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.' Of course, from the Parable of the Sower.  
'Nothing New Under the Sun': Ecclesiastes 1:9 'That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun.'  
'The Writing on the Wall': Daniel 5:5 'In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.' And the writing on the wall, interpreted by the prophet Daniel, tells King Belshazzar that his time is up! (I remember studying the oratorio 'Belshazzar's Feast' by William Walton for my Music 'A' level – I might have to give it a listen today!).  
'Fall From Grace': Galatians 5:4 'You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.'  
'The Root of the Matter': Job 19:28-29 'If you should say, “How shall we persecute him?” - Since the root of the matter is found in me, be afraid of the sword for yourselves; For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.'

many thanks to everyone who - at incredibly short notice - advertised, heard about, and then attended the Rosary and Benediction for Peace last Tuesday at SP's at 6:30pm. It was a very special Holy Hour, and it is suggested we might make this a monthly event – in the third week of the month, complementing our Vespers on the first week? What do you think?
