**Message from Father Peter:**  
When I was in Lourdes earlier this year I saw a statue the like of which I had never seen before. Regrettably I didn’t buy it, but when I was telling a |Parishioner about it they very kindly sourced one and presented it to me (many thanks and blessing to you!). The Statue is of the hand of Jesus, bearing the wound of one of the nails of crucifixion. On the top of the thumb is a figure of the child Jesus, followed, on each finger, by images of Joseph, Mary, and then Mary’s Parents, Jesus’ earthly Grand-parents, Joachim and Anne, with angels at the bottom carrying the instruments of the Crucifixion. The Statue is a popular devotion from Mexico, apparently, and is known as ‘La Mano Poderosa’, the Powerful Hand, or ‘las Cinco Personas’, the Five Persons. Prayers to be recited in front of the Powerful Hand often focus on the Hand of God being able to wisely influence our own actions, and those of events around us, especially in tempestuous times. However, the Statue appeals to me especially because it is an extension of the Holy Family which we celebrate at Christmas, with the inclusion of Joachim and Ann. It makes me think about how they must have pondered the events of the birth of Jesus, perhaps with the confusion of Joseph or the immediate willingness of Mary. I’ll place the Statue on the Lady Altar at SP’s this week, and SJ’s next week, and perhaps you might take the time to say this wonderful prayer of Benedict XVI for our Grandparents. It’s rather good. *Lord Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary, daughter of Saints Joachim and Anne, look with love on grandparents the world over. Protect and support them! As they grow older, may they continue to be for their families strong pillars of Gospel faith, guardians of noble ideals, living treasuries of sound religious traditions. Lord Jesus, help families and society to value the presence and roles of grandparents. Mary, Mother of all the living, keep grandparents constantly in your care, accompany them on their earthly pilgrimage, and by your prayers, grant that all families may one day be reunited in our heavenly homeland, where you await all humanity for the great embrace of life without end. Amen!*.  

**Annual Deanery Mass for Deceased Clergy:**  
This Tuesday 18th at 10am at SJ’s we celebrate the Annual Deanery Mass for Deceased Clergy. All Welcome.  

**Fr. Peter / Star of the Sea:**  
Please note that I’m still covering the 5pm Mass at Star of the Sea, so not around to welcome for the 6pm! Please pray for Fr. Peter that he continues to make an excellent recovery.  

**The Food Bank:**  
during the weeks leading up to Christmas, if it is possible to boost any Food Bank offerings, perhaps with some children’s Christmas type goodies, it would be much appreciated. On Monday 9am Mass at St. Peter’s Pupils from St. Bede’s will bringing some of their Food Bank Donations to the SVP, with blessings and thanks to them for their kindness.  

**Ansdell Christmas Lights Switch On:**  
Saturday 29th November: Everyone is welcome to walk from outside St. Joseph’s at 4pm, singing some Carols, up to the Institute for a Prayer and the Switch On. Dressing up and carrying Lanterns is optional but encouraged! Please note that on this Saturday Woodlands Road will be closed from 2pm-7pm so bear this in mind if you are driving to 6pm Mass.  

**Burkina Faso:**  
The £1,276.76 raised by our 2025 appeal will probably go towards repairing a boundary wall and thus improving the security of Bernardine Community. In the last 5 years jihadis are roaming more and more freely so good security is essential. A further update and photographs will be available on their return. E. Gillett

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
