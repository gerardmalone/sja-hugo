**Message from Father Peter:**  
As you know the weekday readings of the Church run on a two year cycle – this being year 2, as it is an even numbered year, but the Sunday readings run over a three year cycle, each one corresponding to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke (we read the Gospel of St. John scattered throughout the year, though especially right after Christmas and during Eastertide). This being year A, today we embark on the Gospel of St. Matthew. Matthew was a tax collector, and being a rejected Jew he had a good knowledge of the workings and the thought patterns of Judaism. His call to follow Christ was controversial; the very evening of his calling people were ready to criticise Jesus for associating with tax collectors and sinners. Matthew’s call was also very sudden - Jesus called him and he followed, almost as if he was waiting to leave a life he knew to be wrong. All these aspects of his life come through throughout his Gospel, written sometime around 74 – 80 AD. Matthew wanted to show that Christianity, and the life and teaching of Christ was quite in line with Jewish teaching and the prophecies of the Old Testament – many of which Matthew quotes in his Gospel (more than any other Evangelist) and also uses various Jewish storytelling techniques in the Gospel. But Matthew was writing for the Christian communities and is keen to point out that the Word for God is for everyone in the world, and the Church has a worldwide mission to this effect. For Matthew, this is what the Kingdom of Heaven is to be, which Jesus brings, and to which we are all called, and to which we are called to bring others, through our life, our preaching and our prayers. And so as throughout this year we listen to the Gospel of Matthew and celebrate the life and teaching of the Son of God our personal Saviour, let us always have before us the mission of Christ, and his call to each one of us and the world. And let’s be grateful to Saint Matthew for sharing the Word of God with us in such an invigorating and truly life enhancing Gospel. And let us act upon it to do our part in bringing about the Kingdom of God in our lives and our world today.

**The Advent Posada:**  
It is many years since Mary and Joseph journeyed to Bethlehem and found shelter in a stable where Our Lord Jesus was born. They had travelled many miles and through many places of shelter along the way. This year in Lytham then Ansdell and St. Annes they covered just 28 miles as they moved from place to place from St Bede’s to Saltcotes Place to Kielder Court then Commonside to Broadwood Way, Bannister Street to Bellingham Rd, Forest Drive, the Boulevard, Sandringham Road, Balmoral Road, Grand Manor drive, Faulkner Crescent, Elmhurst Road, Arnside Avenue, Hilton Avenue, Lansdowne Road, Arundel Road, Eden Avenue, Windsor Avenue, then St. Bede’s, Elms Avenue, Cartmell Road and finally resting in St. Joseph’s church on the altar. They were received with joy and missed as they left and journeyed on.
