**Message from Father Peter:**  
And so the long Summer Holiday draws to a close, and our schools reopen this week for the new Acadamic Year. As we wish them well and say a prayer for them all, it might be nice to look at a few of the Patron saints appropriate to this time of year, for which there are several:  
Firstly we have St. John Bosco, who, during the nineteenth century in Italy, especially Turin, he dedicated his life to helping disadvantaged young people, seeking to teach with love and hope, rather than punishment. When he was canonized in 1929 he was given the title ‘Father and Teacher of Youth’.  
St. Gemma Galgani is also Patron of Students, an Italian Mystic of the twentieth century, who was an excellent student at school, but suffered with much illness throughout her life, and when she was orphaned at the age of nineteen, looked after and educated her younger brothers and sisters. She was a mystic who received the stigmata of Our Lord, and was canonized in 1940.  
St. Elizabeth Ann Seton is Patron Saint of Catholic Schools and Teachers; at the beginning of the eighteenth century she founded the first Catholic Girls’ School in America - and was the first American to be Canonized.  
And for those off to University, let’s mention their Patron Saint, the great Thomas Aquinas, the amazing Theologian and poet, whose theology on the Eucharist is so important to us – as well as his great Eucharistic hymns we which still sing today.  
God Our Father, as we begin this new Academic Year, we place into your hands all who work in our Schools, our Teachers, our Staff, and our Students. May everything they do be infused with a spirit of your love, that, together we may all grow in knowledge and love of all you have created, and in knowledge and love of you and your Son Jesus, who, united with the Holy Spirit, are one God, living and true, for ever and ever. Amen
