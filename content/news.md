**Holy Week and Easter Mass Times**  
Click [here](/feasts-intentions) for details of all services trhis week.  

**After the Easter Vigil:**  
After the Easter Vigil everyone is welcome into the presbytery for some sherry and chocolate. It is a tradition in Benedictine Monasteries that their monks are allowed five squares of chocolate after the Vigil to give them energy to sing Morning Prayer. So chocolate for all will be provided!

**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
Well, what a Lent. Only six weeks ago the season of prayer and penitence stretched before us and now it concludes with the most amazing joyful services of the whole liturgical Year. This Lent has seen two First Fridays which are always such special occasions, one of which involved a fasting lunch, children bringing a statue of Our Lady, and people being blessed as they spent a night in empathy with the homeless in Blackpool. We had a beautiful Reconciliation Service with our friends from Star of the Sea - and there have many opportunities for individual confession which it has been refreshing to see that people have taken up throughout the season – my absolution arm has been much exercised! Stations of the Cross has seen wonderful attendances at both our churches throughout Lent, and I had the privilege of spending a whole morning taking all our children in school through this great devotion. Mothers have prayed on a Wednesday evening. Our communion children have made their First Confession, and are almost ready for their reception of the Eucharist in May. And a group of adults have been presented to the Bishop and (depending on when you read this) are becoming/have become the latest members, not only of St. Joseph's and St. Peter's but of the whole Universal Church throughout the world – along with thousands of other born again faithful throughout the world. Along with prayer and fasting there has been much almsgiving, both privately, and the many causes drawn to our attention throughout Lent – I can now make a crocheted cross in my sleep! With such a wonderful Lent behind us, let us continue our joyfully fellowship into Easter – and perhaps because of everything we are doing, one day, into the Eternal Easter. Alleluia Alleluia!

**Easter Sunday:**  
Please pray with great joy and gladness for Joyce, Rachel, Alex, Lee, Jake and Richard who were received into Full Communion with the Church at the Easter Vigil and Emy who was baptised. Huge congratulations to them, and many blessings to them on this life changing moment in their spiritual lives.

**A Huge Thank You:**

A very Happy Eastertide to you all!
