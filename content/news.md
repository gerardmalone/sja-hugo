## Message from Father Peter

And so it is that Lent begins on Wednesday, our six weeks of Prayer, Fasting and Almsgiving, in preparation for our great celebrations of the death and resurrection of Christ in Passion and Eastertide.

Ash Wednesday is, of course, a day of Fasting and Abstinence from Meat, one of only two in the Church’s calendar, the other being Good Friday. Fasting means a person is permitted to eat one full meal. Two smaller meals may also be taken, but they are not to equal that of a full meal. The norms of fasting are obligatory from age 18 until age 59, and the rule of abstinence from meat is binding upon Catholics aged 14 and onwards.

Fasting and abstinence is a kind of spiritual exercise, to remind ourselves of our need of God above all other things, and how not to rely on the temporal, passing, material things of this world. It is also a great reminder of the fast of Jesus during his time in the desert, the Gospel of which we will hear on the First Sunday of Lent.

Our ashes on Wednesday are a reminder of our need for repentance, and the forgiveness Christ won for us on the cross on Good Friday. These two symbols are a great beginning of what we should hope to experience and achieve throughout the forty days of this season.

Pope Saint John Paul II described Lent as a “commitment to a new life, inspired by Gospel values,” moving away from selfishness and drawing closer to the path of Christ. That path, he said, can be summarised in the words prayer, fasting and almsgiving, with fasting consisting of moderation in food and lifestyle as “a sincere effort to remove from our hearts all that is the result of sin and inclines us to evil.”

Whatever we do for Lent, let us make a great start this Wednesday.

Lord, may the ashes we receive be a sign to us that our Lent has begun. Bless us during this time of Lenten preparation. Help us to keep our promises to fast, motivate us to share what we have, and guide us to pray and become closer to you. Strengthen us so that we may grow in faith, hope and love and be transformed ready to celebrate Easter. Amen.
