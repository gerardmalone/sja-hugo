**Message from Father Peter:**  
As is traditional on the great Feast of Pentecost, fifty days after Easter as we celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, we have, in the Liturgy of the Word, after the second reading and before the Gospel greeting, a ‘sequence’. Originally Sequences were liturgical poems, which followed on directly form the final note of the Alleluia, and were used for many different liturgical occasions – in fact there were over 5000, apparently. The Church Council of Trent in 1545 abolished most of them, until, after Vatican II we were left with just four, two of which are optional: for Corpus Christi (Lauda Sion) and Our Lady of Sorrows (the Stabat Mater – the text of which is possibly more familiar to us, as it is still used as one of the traditional hymns for the Stations of the Cross); and two remain obligatory: the Easter Sequence (Victimae Paschali Laudes) which is said on Easter Sunday and throughout Easter Week and the Pentecost Sequence (Veni, Sancte Spiritus) which we hear in today’s Mass – now moved to before the Alleluia. This is one of the most beautiful of the sequences (I really don’t like the Easter Week one, at least not in the present English translation), forming a beautiful prayer, begging the Holy Spirit to come among us and change our lives, and change the world, comforting us in all our struggles, and bring us the seven-fold gifts of the Spirit, to be with us throughout the whole of lives until the Spirit eventually ‘gives us comfort when we die’. In essence, the sequence is calling us to take seriously our Confirmation, when we received the fullness of God’s Holy Spirit. It’s a beautiful prayer, and also a beautiful expounding of the Theology of the Holy Spirit. Let’s make it a heartful prayer as we conclude our joyful season of Eastertide on this Feast of Pentecost. Incidentally, do you want to hear my latest joke about the Fibonacci Sequence? It's as good as my previous two Fibonacci sequence jokes put together! I’ll get my coat. And google ‘Fibonacci Sequence’…

**From Edwina Gillett:**  
A big thank you to all who joined me in Lancaster for the Bene Merenti presentation on Saturday 31 May and to all those who came along to St Joseph's for Vespers and Benediction followed by a sherry reception on the following Sunday. I have been quite overwhelmed by all the messages of support, cards, mass offerings, prayers, flowers and even an afternoon tea, quite amazing! Thank you all, Fr Peter will offer a Mass for both parishes in thanksgiving in due course. E.Gillett.
