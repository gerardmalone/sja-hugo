**Message from Father Peter:**  
In the Church we use Relics of Saints as prayerful reminders of their Sanctity and Holiness in this life. We venerate relics as a sign of the intercession that the Saint my plead for us from their vantage in heaven (we may bow before them, but we don’t genuflect to them as we would to the Blessed Sacrament). There are three ‘Classes’ of Relic: A First Class Relic is an actual artifact of a particular Saint; a fragment of bone, a lock of their hair, for example. A Second Class relic is something that the saint actually ownedor used; an item of their clothing, their rosary or their prayer book. And finally, we have Third Class Relics, which are something, such as a piece of cloth, which has been touched by one of the above two classes. Why am I talking about Relics? Because recently I have had two Third Class Relics framed for display and devotion. The First is of Blessed Edmund Arrowsmith, the relic of which was handed on to me by a family for whom we celebrated a requiem recently to whom it belonged. Blessed Edmund is one of our Local Martyrs, from Haydock, who was hung, drawn and quartered in Lancaster on August 28th, 1624. His hand is preserved in Stonyhurst College, along with his vestments, and the preserved cloth has touched his hand. The Second is of our old friend Padre Pio. This relic was given to me some time ago, and has been in my Breviary (the books I used to use, not the Kindle I use now), but I was spurred into framing it as my mate Fr. Ed in Lincoln passed onto me a photo he had being given of Padre Pio which is most unusual in that he is not wearing his gloves (which he invariably is on photographs and statues) and so you can see the actual stigmata, the wounds of Christ, which miraculously appeared on his hands. To venerate a relic, it is simply enough to spend some time in prayer before it, placing your intentions in God’s hands, through the intercession of the particular Saint. I will leave the relics in front of the Altar at SJ’s this week, and at SP’s next week. Prayers and thanks to the donor of the relic and the photo. And through the Intercession of St. Edmund Arrowsmith and St Pio of Pietrelcina, may God bless us all. Amen

**School Stuff:**  
Once again I am making my August Appeal to you for stations items - pens, pencils, pencil cases, school bags whatever, for those children who might need a little help with their supplies for the new school year. I’d also add this a plea for ‘scientific calculators’ and tinned ‘geometry sets’ for a Secondary School I am in contact with, who would greatly appreciate them. There is a box at the back of Church, and please be assured that all donations will go to those most in need. There are boxes at the back of the Church. Many thanks in anticipation. (I’ll be blessing backpacks for the New Year on Sunday 7th).
