**Message from Father Peter:**  
There were a few raised eyebrows in our Churches – and Sacristies for that matter – over the Epiphany, when I made the traditional ‘Noveritis 2026’. This is the announcement of the date of Easter and the Movable Feasts for the present liturgical year. As you know the date of Easter changes every year, being the First Sunday after the First Full Moon after the Spring Equinox, which means that other dates are affected accordingly. In the days when people had no easy access to a liturgical calendar, and couldn’t just Google or ask Alexa, the proclamation was made after the Gospel on the Feast of the Epiphany. The tradition fell into disuse in the last century as it was considered unnecessary but has been slowly brought back, as it reminds us of the Universal nature of the Church, proclaiming to the whole world the dates the whole Church will be gathering for its most important Feasts. It also reminds us that everything in the calendar – and hopefully our lives – revolves around the Resurrection of Jesus. It’s called the ‘Noveritis’ after the opening words ‘We announce’, and it even has a tune for it to be sung (if I don’t have this cough next year I might sing it). This year’s text was as follows: Announcement of the date of Easter and movable feasts: Know, dear brethren that, as we have rejoiced at the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, so by leave of God’s mercy we announce to you also the joy of his Resurrection, who is our Saviour. On the eighteenth day of February will fall Ash Wednesday, and the beginning of the fast of the most sacred Lenten season. On the fifth day of April you will celebrate with joy Easter Day, the Paschal feast of our Lord Jesus Christ. On the fourteenth day of May will be the Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ. On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the feast of Pentecost. On the seventh day of June, the feast of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ. On the twenty-ninth day of November, the First Sunday of the Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. Incidentally, did you hear about the guy who was arrested for stealing a calendar? He got twelve months. I’ll get my coat… and my diary…  

**Continued Personal Thanks from Father Peter**  
For all the kind Cards, Gifts, and Offerings over the Christmas season. Mass will be said in thanksgiving for all your intentions. God bless you. And Feline Thanks from Tobias, the Presbytery Cat, for all the kind treats and toys received over the Christmas season.  

**SJSP Confirmation 2026.**  
The Bishop will be coming to SJSP’s to confer the Sacrament of Confirmation on Tuesday 10th February at SP’s at 6:30pm. Please pray for the Candidates who have registered for the course as they make this important step on their faith journey.  

**The Lenten Houses.**  
In his Christmas message Fr. Steven Jerry Ochieng, MCSPA of the Missionary Community of St. Paul the Apostle wrote: Signs of God's Providence This year has brought other remarkable blessings too. Four houses for our brothers and sisters living with albinism now stand completed with three built with the help of Christians from St Joseph in Ansdell, St Peters in Lytham and St. Bernadette’s in Bispham in England, offering not just shelter but dignity, safety, and a tangible sign that they are valued members of our community. Each house represents a family no longer living in fear, children who can play freely, and parents who can rest peacefully. Many blessings to everyone who supported last year’s amazing Lenten project.  

**Late Late Christmas Party**

**Memorial of St. Kentigern, or Mungo:**  
This Tuesday the 13th is the Memorial of St. Kentigern, or Mungo as he is also known. He was a missionary in Strathclyde and eventually became their bishop. He had to leave due to persecution and then preached in north-west England and Wales. He returned to Scotland later and died in 603. He is buried in Glasgow, and is Patron Saint of the City, and one of the secondary Patrons of Scotland.  

**Memorial of Anthony:**  
This Saturday 17th is the Memorial of Anthony who was born near Memphis in Upper Egypt in 251. Before he was twenty he inherited a large estate when his parents died. He was impressed with the Christian message to ‘go sell what you have and give to the poor’. He did just that – putting his sister in a Convent - and spent the rest of his life as a hermit in various parts of Egypt. He founded a number of monasteries. At one stage he was asked by the bishops to preach against the Arians, who did not believe in the divinity of Christ (I mentioned this in my Christmas Sermon – Mary ‘kissed the face of God’ showing belief in the divinity of Jesus). All were very impressed by his character and words. He was over a hundred when he died.
