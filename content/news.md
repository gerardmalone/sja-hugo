**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
As I said on Monday and Tuesday evening, for me Lent has truly begun when I celebrate the wonderful devotion that is The Stations of the Cross. Tradition suggests Mary herself used to follow the Way of the Cross each day, and from earliest days of Christianity in Jerusalem people used to pray the road Christ walked on Good Friday, although at first they began at the place of Resurrection and moved back to the beginning in Pilate's Court. Over the year Stations began to be created in other places for people who were unable to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Franciscans in particular started creating Stations en route to their Churches, and in the middle of the fifteenth century an English pilgrim called William Wey came up with the word 'stations' to refer to each stopping point of prayer. In 1731 Pope Clement XII gave permission for all Churches to have Stations of the Cross as long as they were built by Franciscans, and it was at this time that the Stations were fixed in the form we know them today. It was not until 1857 that the Bishops of England were given permission to erect Stations of the Cross themselves. It is such a beautiful devotion. Please make an effort to attend our Stations Services, and I have put copies of the traditional Stations of St. Alphonsus at the back of Church if anyone wishes to pray them in Church or at home privately. We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee. Because by thy Holy Cross thou hast redeemed the world.  

**Lenten Lunch:**

**Fr Peter's Lenten Challenge House Appeal:**  
as announced last week I am trying to raise £3000 to build a house (with lockable doors and windows) for a family with children with Albinism, to help save them from cruelty from within their own society, and abduction and torture from others. My challenge is to make a crafted cross (or two) every day during Lent. All donations are gratefully accepted, and envelopes are available at the back of Church. Please check out the pictures from Fr. Stephen in Malawi, and many thanks in anticipation.  

**CAFOD Lent Appeal:**

**Message from Fr. Philip Newbold.**  
I am undertaking a Sponsored Walk of 10,000 paces for the 40 days of Lent. It is to support the work of "Aid to the Church in Need" & a project on the border area between Lebanon/Syria. The project provides a hot meal each weekday for 1500 people. Many are refugees from Syria & displaced Lebanese, after their own country was bombed. You may like to sponsor me? If so, there are sponsor sheets in church, so include your address & postcode if you wish to Gift Aid your donation.
