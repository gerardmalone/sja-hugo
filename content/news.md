**Message from Father Peter:**  
I mentioned at the beginning of last Sunday’s Mass, the Gospel of which spoke about Martha and Mary, that this Tuesday 29th we celebrate the rather lovely Feast of the Holy Family of Bethany, Saints Mary, Martha and Lazarus. Jesus was obviously a great friend of the family, going to visit Martha and Mary upon hearing of their brother Lazarus’s death, and the outpouring of faith and belief in their darkest hour, brings about Jesus’ stunning and compassionate miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead. As well as expressing their faith in Christ and the resurrection, the family famously offer hospitality to Jesus, on a number of occasions in the Scriptures, firstly as we heard last week, from Luke 10:38-42, when Martha bustled in the kitchen and Mary listened to Jesus’ preaching, and also, most importantly, not least just before Christ’s own death, as recorded in John 12:1-7, with Martha, this time appropriately serving Christ as well as her brother Lazarus at the table (with some people wanting to kill Lazarus because of his association with Christ and his miraculous raising), with Mary anointing Jesus in preparation for his burial. But what happened after Jesus’ resurrection? There are various traditions, but several of them speak of the family travelling to France, with Lazarus having a stop off in Cyprus, where he was Bishop, before journeying on to Marseilles, where he was the first Bishop, and martyred there. Martha evangelized to the people of Provence, and one story tells of her slaying ‘la Tarasque’, a half-animal-half-fish monster, by sprinkling it with Holy water, before tying it up with her apron. It is said that Mary of Bethany was with the family till the end in France too. When Pope Francis declared July 29th a Feast of not only Martha, but Mary and Lazarus together it was stated, ‘Martha generously offered him hospitality, Mary listened attentively to his words and Lazarus promptly emerged from the tomb at the command of the one who humiliated death.’ God our Father, whose Son enjoyed the love of his friends, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, in learning, witness, and hospitality: may we so rejoice in your love that the world may come to know the depths of your wisdom, the wonder of your compassion, and your power to bring life out of death; through the merits of Jesus Christ, our friend and brother, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. Now last week I mentioned in my homily that Mary recognised Christ’s voice at his resurrection, so is Mary of Bathany the same person as Mary Magdalene? I’ll discuss that question in another ‘message’ - it’s a theological can of hornets…

We committed to support the community in our centenary year so please be as generous you can to provide the Bernardines with continued vital funding to support their mission.

**Diocesan Centenery Prayer:**  
Father in heaven, may the faith you have given us in your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, and the 昀ame of charity enkindled in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, reawaken in us the blessed hope for the coming of your Kingdom. May your grace transform us into tireless cultivators of the seeds of the Gospel. May those seeds transform from within both humanity and the whole cosmos in the sure expectation of a new heaven and a new earth, when, with the powers of Evil vanquished, your glory will shine eternally. May the grace of the Jubilee reawaken in us, Pilgrims of Hope, a yearning for the treasures of heaven. May that same grace spread the joy and peace of our Redeemer throughout the earth. To you our God, eternally blessed, be glory and praise for ever.
