**Message from Father Peter:**  
Last Sunday I mentioned that the New Translation of the Scriptures somewhat bowled me a googley in changing Jesus’s description of the Holy Spirit as an ‘Advocate’ to ‘helper’. Lo and behold the following day on Monday’s Scripture reading there was another googley, when, in Acts of the Apostles 16:11-15 we catch up with St. Paul, on his Second Missionary Journey, where he reaches Macedonia and goes to the town of Philippi, where they meet Lydia, a devout woman, who, in the previous translation we were told worked in the expensive ‘purple dye and linen trade’. This was quite a noble task. Purple dye was expensive because of the way in which it was made, involving collecting thousands of snails, which were then boiled (causing one heck of stink), eventually becoming transformed into the valuable purple dye, used to adorn regal robes – you’ll remember that Christ was mockingly given a purple robe. Lydia was obviously an intelligent and astute businesswoman. She and her whole household are baptized, and then she insists that Paul and his companions stay with her throughout their visits. And after one of his stays in prison Paul stayed with Lydia again. She is now venerated as a Saint, and her prayer references her purple dye and cloth trade: O Holy Eternal Fire grant to us, as You did for Thy child St. Lydia, the gift of conversion and transformation that our ears and our hearts may be opened to hearing and understanding Thy words of life so that we, too, may better serve Thee as a community through our gifts and talents so as to bring Hope to those who are in need of You through us. We ask Thee, O blessed Mother and Queen, for Thy holy intercession that you may weave within us, and those whom we are called to serve, all the graces necessary for the Will of God to be accomplished in us so that a royal tapestry of Faith and good works may be offered and made pleasing to our God. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and King. Amen. Rather a lovely prayer, don’t you think? Alas, the new translation makes no reference to any of this and just tells us that Lydia was ‘a seller of purple goods’, which I guess could be anything – aubergines, iPad covers, who knows…? Incidentally, did you hear about the hopeful farmer who loved purple? He had great eggplantations. I’ll get my coat. And my umbrella – it looks like [purple rain](https://youtu.be/TvnYmWpD_T8?si=8s4YrRk5VQPdUZJV)…

*The Benemerenti Medal was first given by Pope Pius VI as a military award for soldiers. Under Pope Gregory XVI (1831–1846) a special Benemerenti medal was created to reward those who fought courageously in the Papal army at Ferrara, Bologna, and Vienna. In 1925, under Pope Pius XI, this medal began to be awarded to civil, military, laity and clergy, in recognition of exceptional service to the Catholic Church.*
