**Message from Father Peter:**  
We are blessed at SJSP’s to have beautiful music at our weekend services, and other services throughout the work too (especial thanks to all our singers and musicians), which enable us to sing many and varied hymns from the vast and great (and sometimes not-so-great) Hymnology of the Church. Surely one of our greatest and joyful hymns is the Anthem of today’s Feast, ‘Hail Redeemer King Divine’. As you know the Sundays of the Year run on a three year cycle and the verses of this hymn make reference to this, speaking of the Kingship of Christ in its different ways: in Year A we think of the whole of Creation bowing before the King at the Last Judgement; Year B focuses on the King whose Kingdom is not of this world; whilst Year C, of which this is the last Sunday, sees the Kingdom, Paradise, being offered to even the most unlikely, who put their trust in him. The Hymn also speaks of the Kingdom of Christ as a Shepherd guides his flock, and even makes reference to Him guiding the Youth, a salutary reminder to us all about the future of the Church – and also that this is ‘Youth Sunday’ in England and Wales. There are so many facets to this final Sunday of the Church’s Year, just as there are of the title ‘Christ the King’. However we wish to celebrate this Feast lets make sure that we echo in our prayers and in our lives the chorus of this great hymn, and make it a fitting end to our Liturgical Year, as we look forward to beginning another Year with the First Sunday of Advent next week and make our preparations for the celebration of the birth of this King: *‘Angels, Saints and Nations sing: ‘Praise be Jesus Christ our King; Lord of life, earth, sky and sea, King of love on Calvary!’*

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.  

**Email Address:**  
The Diocese is changing all email addresses. The one email for our two parishes is now [sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk](mailto:sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk). Please do whatever you have to do to use this email from now on. Cheers.

**St Joseph’s Care:**  
Do you know of anyone in our community who is in need or might need a little more support? Company or just someone to talk to? Someone who may, at times, need help with things? Please let us know and we can contact them. Or you can give them our St Joseph’s Care phone number so they can contact us: Tel: 07840112265.  

**St Joseph’s Facebook Page:**  
We now have over 300 people regularly following us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Josephs-Roman-Catholic-Church-Ansdell/230000653837017) which is allowing us to reach out to those in the wider community and fulfill our parish commitment to evangelization. In the last couple of months, we have been able to help a number of people who have sought assistance through this medium.
