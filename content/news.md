### Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes

This Wednesday we celebrate the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, Patroness of our Diocese of Lancaster. Whilst we are all familiar with the story of Bernadette of Lourdes (I hope! If not, YouTube *The Song of Bernadette*; the whole film is there), it’s worth reminding ourselves of the words the Mother of God actually spoke.

In the Scriptures Mary says very little: assenting to the will of God at the Annunciation, making her great Magnificat song when she was greeted by Elizabeth, and expressing her worry when her Son was lost in the Temple at the age of twelve. Other than that, nothing — so the words she spoke to Bernadette must be important.

Here they are, in full:

> “It is not necessary.”
> (On being offered pen and paper by Bernadette and asked to write down what she wanted)
>
> “Would you have the graciousness to come here for fifteen days?”
>
> “I do not promise you happiness in this world, but in the next.”
>
> “Pray for sinners.”
>
> “Go drink at the spring and wash yourself in it.”
>
> “Penance! Penance! Penance!”
>
> Bernadette was also told to eat some leaves from a green herb, and  
> “Kiss the ground as a penance for sinners.”
>
> “You will tell the priests to have a chapel built here.”
>
> And finally, and most powerfully:  
> **“I am the Immaculate Conception.”**

Oh ever immaculate Virgin, Mother of Mercy, Health of the Sick, Refuge of Sinners, Comforter of the Afflicted, you know my wants, my troubles, my sufferings. Look upon me with mercy. When you appeared in the grotto of Lourdes, you made it a privileged sanctuary where you dispense your favours, and where many sufferers have obtained the cure of their infirmities, both spiritual and corporal.

I come, therefore, with unbounded confidence to implore your maternal intercession. My loving Mother, obtain my request. I will try to imitate your virtues so that I may one day share your company and bless you in eternity. Amen.

### Please pray for Bishop Paul and our Diocese on this Patronal Feast
