**Message from Father Peter:**  
Well, the Summer Holidays may have started, but the Liturgical Calendar takes no rest at all, and this week is one of those weeks which has a Saint for every day! So here goes…  
*Monday 21st* is the Memorial of St. Laurence of Brindisi, a priest and doctor of the 6th Century Church in Italy, who travelled throughout Europe, preaching and teaching (he was an impressive linguist, and was able to preach to Jewish communities in Hebrew), and promoting much needed reform in the Church.  
*Tuesday 22nd* is the Feast of Saint Mary Magdalen, whose life we know was completely changed by encounter with the Lord, and because of her faithfulness to Christ throughout his ministry and death on the cross was granted the first appearance of Christ at his Resurrection, and was also the first to be charged with the mission to tell others about the Risen Christ.  
*Wednesday 23rd* is the Feast of St. Bridget of Sweden, born into the upper echelons of society in Sweden in the 14th Century, having eight children, before, after her husbands death, devoting her life to work for the Church, eventually going to Rome where she founded the religious order known as the Bridgettines (any of you who have visited the English College in Rome where I trained might have noticed the Bridgettine Convent next door, where as students we used to go and serve Benediction on a Sunday afternoon, and were rewarded with luscious cakes).  
*Thursday 24th* is the Memorial of the Saint John Boste, Blessed Christopher Robinson, and his companions, the Martyrs of Cumbria, ten men, from all walks of life, from the present country of Cumbria. Today we pray that their deaths, in the words of St. John Boste, ‘may speak in our hearts’.  
*Friday 25th* is the Feast of St. James, the Apostle, brother of John, a Son of Zebedee, who was one of the first Apostles to be martyred in 44AD.  
*Saturday 26th* is the Memorial of Saint Joachim and Anne, the parents of the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose names come from the earliest traditions of the Church (they are not mentioned in the Scriptures), which tell us that Anne conceived in her old age, and in gratitude, served God in his Temple.  

**Large Print:**  
As requested, Large Print newsletters and missalettes are available at the back of Church.  

**End of the Academic Year:**  
as the School Year ends we wish all our Leaners, Teachers and Staff a well-earned happy and relaxing holiday after a wonderful year. We especially say a fond farewell to Year 6 as they move on to pastures new, and look forward to welcoming a new Reception Class in September.  

**Burkina Faso:**  
our annual appeal is now open and envelopes for donations are available at the back of church which can be returned via the offertory collection. So far, we have supported the Bernardine Community by helping to build and furnish a church, provide livestock and agricultural items, new lectionaries and improved printing facilities. We committed to support the community in our centenary year so please be as generous you can to provide the Bernardines with continued vital funding to support their mission. The appeal will remain open until 7 September. E.Gillett.  

**A Message from St. Peter’s School:**  
A Heartfelt Thank You. We would like to extend our sincere thanks to St Peter's St. Vincent de Paul Society and St Joseph’s Care Group for their continued support of our school families. Your generous donations of cash and supermarket vouchers make a real difference—especially during the school holidays—by helping to ease the financial pressures many families face. Your kindness and compassion are deeply appreciated. Thank you for being a vital part of our community.

**Diocesan Centenery Prayer:**  
Father in heaven, may the faith you have given us in your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, and the 昀ame of charity enkindled in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, reawaken in us the blessed hope for the coming of your Kingdom. May your grace transform us into tireless cultivators of the seeds of the Gospel. May those seeds transform from within both humanity and the whole cosmos in the sure expectation of a new heaven and a new earth, when, with the powers of Evil vanquished, your glory will shine eternally. May the grace of the Jubilee reawaken in us, Pilgrims of Hope, a yearning for the treasures of heaven. May that same grace spread the joy and peace of our Redeemer throughout the earth. To you our God, eternally blessed, be glory and praise for ever.
