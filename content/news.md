**Message from Deacon David (who was present in Rome for the announcement of Pope Leo’s election and his First Blessing):**  
Unlike human leaders, who come and go and make mistakes, Christ remains forever. He is our High Priest — eternal, sinless, unchanging — and thank God for that! And yet, Jesus in His divine wisdom did something rather daring: He entrusted His Church to us — to human hands. He built His Church not on angels, but on Peter. A fisherman who was bold, flawed, impulsive and relied upon more passion than planning. And now, in that same spirit, we welcome another man who has dared to say yes to the same call: to be the successor of Peter. Now, Pope Leo XIV takes his name from a legendary line of papal Leos — including, of course, Pope Leo XIII, the great champion of Catholic social teaching, who wrote Rerum Novarum and somehow made theology sound poetic while talking about workers' rights. Leo XIII was called the “Pope of the working class,” the “Pope of reason,” So Pope Leo XIV — no pressure! But we know this: the papacy is not a platform for personal greatness, but a call to radical service. It’s a position where you trade privacy for prayer requests, and comfort for a cross. The white cassock may look clean, but as every pope quickly learns, it’s a working uniform. Jesus is “holy, innocent, uncontaminated, beyond the influence of sinners” — a description, I might add, that no pope would dare apply to himself! But it is Christ, not the Pope, who saves us. The Pope is not a replacement for Christ — he is a signpost pointing to Him, a voice echoing His Gospel, and a shepherd echoing the care of the Good Shepherd Himself. So as Pope Leo XIV begins his ministry, we pray he will have the wisdom of Leo XIII, the courage of Peter, but most importantly — the humility to keep Christ at the centre. And perhaps, may he also have the humour to survive Vatican meetings, and the stamina to greet pilgrims who never seem to run out of babies to bless. Let us pray for our Holy Father: that he may guide the Church not with power, but with love; not by his own strength, but through Christ, who lives and intercedes forever. And may we, because we have a part to play as faithful members of the Church, may we walk with him — praying, supporting, and listening — always keeping our eyes on Jesus, the one true and eternal High Priest.

*The Benemerenti Medal was first given by Pope Pius VI as a military award for soldiers. Under Pope Gregory XVI (1831–1846) a special Benemerenti medal was created to reward those who fought courageously in the Papal army at Ferrara, Bologna, and Vienna. In 1925, under Pope Pius XI, this medal began to be awarded to civil, military, laity and clergy, in recognition of exceptional service to the Catholic Church.*
