**Message from Father Peter:**  
And so today we celebrate the visit of the three kings to the stable in Bethlehem. Well yes and no. The meaning of today’s feast, which you will have come to know and understood through my erudite sermon at our masses this week, is clear, but there are a few questions as to the first statement I made in this message. The only mention to this event is in the Gospel of St. Matthew in which he describes some men coming from the East. Tradition, which is hugely important to our faith, has led us to believe they are Kings because of the richness of the gifts, and wise men, because of their studies of stars which led them to Bethlehem. Whereabout in the East they came from is not mentioned, though some scholars suggest Arabia, due to the nature of the gifts, or Persia, whose religious leaders were renowned stargazers. The number of the Kings settled at three because of their three gifts, and by 700AD the names of Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar were recorded. The alleged bodies of the Kings are in Cologne Cathedral, where it states they met their final days in Armenia, all dying in the first week of January, having celebrated mass, and all living to be over one hundred years old. But did they visit the stable, as is often pictured? St. Matthew implies that the events of Christmas happened quickly, one after the other, but references in Luke to the Holy Family settling in Nazareth after the Presentation, and not returning to Bethlehem, suggest the Epiphany could have taken place there – possibly when Jesus was up to two years old, but before the flight in to Egypt, obviously, as Herod wanted to kill all children below the age of two. It’s those things that theologians and scholars like to get in a twist about. Perhaps it’s just better to pray *O Holy Magi, you were living in continual expectation of the rising of the Star of Jacob, which would announce the birth of the true Son of justice; obtain for me an increase of faith and charity, and the grace to live in continual hope of beholding, one day, the light of heavenly glory and eternal joy. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen*.

**Year of Jubilee 2025:**
As Bishop Paul explained in last week’s Pastoral Letter Pope Francis has begun a Year of Jubilee for 2025 by opening the Holy Doors in St Peter’s Basilica and in the Arch-Basilica of St John Lateran, the Cathedral of Rome. These Jubilee Years have been announced by popes every twenty five years since 1300 AD and the theme of this Jubilee is hope. Pope Francis has published a Bull of Indiction – an official document to proclaim the Jubilee. It is entitled Spes Non Confundit ‘Hope does not disappoint’ (Rom 5:5). You can download a pdf of the document, in which the pope speaks about the themes of the Jubilee [here](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/20240509_spes-non-confundit_bolla-giubileo2025.pdf).  

**Crib Offerings:**  
Bishop Paul has asked that Collections this year be sent to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem who are helping support the Catholic Christians in the Gaza Strip during this time of terrible conflict and suffering. Bishop Paul asks that we keep this collection open until the Feast of the Lord’s Presentation, 2nd February.
