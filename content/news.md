**Message from Father Peter:**  
Monday was a busy day, but a lovely day. It started with my usual walk to SP’s for 9am Mass, followed by Confession sand Exposition. After a quick decaff skinny latte in Wetherspoons (cheapest coffee in town), bumping into parishioners in there having their post-mass breakfast, it was on to St. Peter’s School for a lovely Mass with Year 6 and Reception together, with Parents and Grandparents, on the theme of allowing our Good Works to be seen, as St. Philip did when he met the Ethiopian on the road, baptizing him in a roadside pool of water. After Mass, on the way back to the Presbytery, I managed a visit to one of sick Parishioners (whilst I obviously don’t always have the Blessed Sacrament with me, I do generally carry my Holy Oil of the Infirm (in that handy little pocket in the right of my jeans)), and how grateful we should all be to SJ’s Care and SP’s SVP for their regular visiting of our sick. After a quick lunch (a healthy bowl of All Bran), I walked up to Clifton Hospital. Each week the chaplain of the Victoria sends messages of any Patients who have been transferred, so I was able to make contact with four Patients (one of whom was an old dear Parishioner I knew from Bispham). Then it was a quick walk to Stella Matutina for the Vigil Reception Mass for dear Sister Margaret, in preparation for her requiem the following day. At the Mass I also had the opportunity to anoint all the residents who were in the chapel for their regular four o’clock celebration of Mass on TV with Holy Communion from the Tabernacle. Then back to SJs for Monthly Vespers, which, being the month of July, and following the Church’s monthly themes, was in Honour of the Precious Blood of Christ. The day ended with our weekly session with the SJSP Ukulele Orchestra – an hour every week which could not be more happy and fun. So, having walked 20,842 steps, covering 16.2 kilometres, it only remained to say Compline, the last prayer of the Church’s day, before bed. What a wonderful day, and how blessed am I to have been called by the Lord to do such work, for so many amazing people, and participate in His mission here at SJSP’s!

**Holy Hour:**  
Holy Hour with Rosary and Benediction at St. Peter’s at 6:30-7-30pm on Tuesday 15th July. All Welcome to come for the whole hour or just a few minutes of prayer.
As you can see above, following on from the Hour for Peace a few weeks ago, we’ll try out a regular Holy Hour, alternating the venue each month, as we do with vespers. It’s a beautiful opportunity to come together in prayer, so please do come for the hour, or just part of the time, to pray, in community, for all our intentions. Please make these services worthwhile by your attendance.  

As requested, **Large Print newsletters and missalettes** are available at the back of Church.

**St. Peter’s End of Year School Mass:**  
Everyone is welcome to join us at St. Peter’s on Wednesday morning at 9am as we celebrate Mass with the whole school as they celebrate the end of the Academic year,

**Burkina Faso:**  
our annual appeal is now open and envelopes for donations are available at the back of church which can be returned via the offertory collection. So far, we have supported the Bernardine Community by helping to build and furnish a church, provide livestock and agricultural items, new lectionaries and improved printing facilities. We committed to support the community in our centenary year so please be as generous you can to provide the Bernardines with continued vital funding to support their mission. The appeal will remain open until 7 September. E.Gillett

**A Message from St. Peter’s School:**  
A Heartfelt Thank You. We would like to extend our sincere thanks to St Peter's St. Vincent de Paul Society and St Joseph’s Care Group for their continued support of our school families. Your generous donations of cash and supermarket vouchers make a real difference—especially during the school holidays—by helping to ease the financial pressures many families face. Your kindness and compassion are deeply appreciated. Thank you for being a vital part of our community.
