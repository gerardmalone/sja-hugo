**Message from Father Peter:**  
Tomorrow we celebrate the lovely Feast of The Presentation of the Lord, a Feast of the Holy Family of Nazareth, otherwise known as ‘Candlemas,’ and the traditional conclusion of our Christmas celebrations. It commemorates the presentation of Jesus in the Temple eight days after his birth, an occasion when offerings were made and the mother was ritually purified. Simeon’s prophecy referred to Jesus as ‘a light to enlighten the pagans,’ summing up the Christmas theme of light coming into the darkness, but also points towards the paschal mystery, for ‘he was destined to be a sign that is rejected,’ neatly moving us from Christmas through to Passiontide and Eastertide. The Gospel Luke 2:22-40 tells us of the Presentation of Jesus, with Simeon praying what has become known as the ‘Nunc Dimmitus’, used in the Night Prayer of the Church; ‘Now master, you can let your servant go in peace, Just as you promised; Because my eyes have seen the salvation Which you prepared for all the nations to see, A light to enlighten the pagans, And the glory of your people Israel.’ We also meet the prophetess Anna who ‘spoke of the child to all who looked forward to the deliverance of Israel.’ The Gospel concludes with the Holy Family returning to Nazareth; ‘Meanwhile the child grew to maturity and was filled with wisdom; and God’s favour was with him.’ Traditionally we bless candles on this Feast Day, to be used throughout the liturgical year, and this is one of the beautiful blessings with which we are provided: O God, true light who create light eternal, Spreading it far and wide, Pour, we pray, into the hearts of the faithful, The brilliance of perpetual light, So that all who are brightened in your holy temple By the splendour of these candles May happily reach the light of your glory. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. A lovely Feast. Time to put away the Christmas cribs and look forward to, in just a couple of weeks’ time, beginning our Lenten journey.
