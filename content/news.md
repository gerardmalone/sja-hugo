**Message from Father Peter:**  
And once again this Friday is the First Friday of the Month (are there two First Fridays every month, or am I just getting old?), which means of course we have our Healing Mass held at SJ's with Anointing of the Sick, followed by refreshments in the Hall. Of course, we could have this Mass any day of the month at all, but First Friday's have a special place in the devotional life of the Church. In the seventeenth century Our Lord appeared to Margaret Mary Aloque between 1673 and 1675, at the Convent of the Visitation in Paray-le-Monial, in the middle of France (not far from the town of Ars, known to us as being the home Parish of the great Patron of Priests in Parishes, St. John Vianney) during which Our Lord revealed to Margaret his Most Sacred Heart, symbolising his love for mankind, which was so often sadly rejected. Our Lord encouraged Margaret to spread devotion to his Most Sacred Heart, one way of which was to make a devotion of nine First Fridays in Reparation for sins against the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In the words of St. Margaret: 'On Friday during Holy Communion, “He said these words to His unworthy slave, if I mistake not: 'I promise you in the excessive mercy of My Heart that Its all-powerful love will grant to all those who receive Holy Communion on nine first Fridays of consecutive months the grace of final repentance; they will not die under My displeasure or without receiving their sacraments, My divine Heart making Itself their assured refuge at the last moment.'” Traditionally as well as receiving Holy Communion you go to Confession, although it is also said that this is only necessary if you conscientiously believe it to be so. As we have a First Friday Mass, when not make this beautiful devotion a part of your regular prayer life? I'm usually around beforehand if you would like confession, also. This is St. Margaret's Prayer to the Sacred Heart: 'Lord Jesus, let my heart never rest until it finds You, who are its centre, its love, and its happiness. By the wound in Your heart pardon the sins that I have committed whether out of malice or out of evil desires. Place my weak heart in your own divine heart, continually under your protection and guidance, so that I may persevere in doing good and in fleeing evil until my last breath. Amen.'

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
