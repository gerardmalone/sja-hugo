**Statement from the Catholic Diocese of Lancaster UK Upon the election of Pope Leo XIV.**  
May 8th 2025. Together with the Universal Church, and with all people of good will, the Catholic Diocese of Lancaster in the UK welcomes and commends to the grace of Almighty God Cardinal Robert Prevost OSA as Pope Leo XIV, the successor of St Peter. Pope Leo comes to this universal ministry after many years of professed and ordained life as deacon priest and as a bishop, as a religious, and as a teacher. As with his predecessors we hold the Holy Father in our prayers and take courage already from the words of his inaugural address with its call for peace across humanity. The times we live in cry out for a fundamentally different approach to serve the world order, one led by Christ. I ask you to do all you can in your parishes and homes to ensure that our loyalty to the Holy Father is Gospel led, not media led. May we also rejoice in learning that, as Father General of the Order of Saint Augustine, Father Prevost was present in our Cathedral of Saint Peter for the Episcopal Ordination of my predecessor, Bishop Michael Campbell OSA on 31st March 2008. Mary the Mother of God. Pray for him. St Peter. Pray for him. St John Paul II. Pray for him, Pope Saint Leo the Great, pray for him.  

**First Reconciliation and Holy Communion:**  
Congratulations to our twenty candidates who this weekend on Saturday afternoon at SP’s received the Blessed Sacrament for the First Time. We bless them and their families at this special time. We will celebrate with them at each church this morning. And huge thanks to our wonderful catechetical team. May God bless them for their ministry.

**Pastoral Letter:**  
this weekend we have Bishop’s Letter for Good Shepherd Sunday. Copies are available at the back of Church.

**Fr Peter’s Lenten Challenge House Appeal:**  
Dear friends at St Joseph’s, St Peter’s and St Bernadette’s, After our visit to you in February, when we came to thank you for raising the money for three fishing boats, I was amazed to hear that Fr Peter had set a new Lenten challenge to raise £3000 to build a house for an albino family here in Malawi. I was also very touched as the need only came up in a conversation over a coffee! On Easter Sunday I received a video of Fr Peter announcing at Mass that you had donated over £8K and likely to reach £9K – enough for three houses! I was speechless and It took me a few minutes for it to register. The news came when I was with colleagues and we celebrated your generosity, fellowship and compassion. Three very vulnerable families in bad situations are going to benefit immensely from your kindness – I cannot tell you how grateful we are. I will write again with an update and pictures of the houses being constructed. In the meantime, I pray for you all and for your wonderful charity and I look forward to seeing you all again next year when we come to stay with our friends. Love and prayers, Fr Steven, Missionary Community of St Paul the Apostle. (MCSPA)  

**Edwina Gillett Papal Award:**  
Papal Award for Services to the Diocese: At the 12:15 pm Mass on Saturday 31 May I am to receive the Bene Merenti from Bishop Paul in the Cathedral, Lancaster. This will be followed by a reception at Lancaster Golf Club. Unfortunately, because numbers at the reception are restricted, I haven’t been able to invite everyone to the celebration but I have tried to invite a cross section of people from across our two parishes to participate in the day. However, everyone is welcome at the Cathedral should you wish to come along, you will be very welcome. On the following day, Sunday 1 June, we will have a Deanery celebration in St Joseph’s to which everyone is invited. It will take the form of Evening Prayer and Benediction at 4pm followed by a sherry reception in the Presbytery. E. Gillett.
