**Message from Father Peter:**
Well Summer has definitely changed to Autumn, and there is possibly even a somewhat wintry chill in the air, and it got me thinking about whether there are Patron Saints for different weather conditions, and sure, enough Holy Mother Church does not let us down in this regard.  If we are ever hoping for a bit of sunshine, then we seek the intercession of St. Medard, who was born in Northen France in the fifth century. Legend tells us that as a child he was sheltered from stormy weather by an eagle, and so he is the go-to saint for good weather in general, and is there to be invoked in times of wind and storm.  For rain we have of course to mention St. Swithin, as I’m sure you know the suggestion that if it rains on his Feast Day - July 15th - it will rain for the next forty days, or as the saying goes, ‘Saint Swithin’s day, if thou dost rain, for forty days it will remain; Saint Swithin’s day, if thou be fair, for forty days will rain nae mair’, or, more prosaically, ‘If on Saint Swithin’s day it really pours, you’re better off to stay indoors’. The legends comes from his humility to be buried outside his Cathedral – he was a ninth century Bishop of Winchester - allowing rain if it was necessary to fall upon him. He is called upon in time of droughts.  Incidentally, in Brazil they seek the intercession of St. Peter against inclement weather conditions. I imagined that this would be something to do with Jesus calming the storm or walking on water, and Peter trying to do the same, but it is more to do with Peter holding the keys of heaven, and able to open the heavens -for rain when necessary.  This is the Official Collect Prayer in the Missal for Fine Weather: *Almighty ever-living God, who heal us through correction, and save us by your forgiveness, grant to those who seek your favour that we may rejoice at the good weather for which we hope and always what in your goodness you bestow for the glory of your name and for our well being. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever*. Incidentally, did you know that tomorrow’s weather is rseowhs – scattered showers. I’ll get my raincoat…

**Diocesan Centenary Mass:**

Please pray the Diocesan Centenary Prayer: God our Father, we thank you for all the graces and blessings You have bestowed on our Diocese since its foundation one hundred years ago on ground made fertile by the blood of the martyrs.  Nourished by your Son, Jesus Christ, in Word and Sacraments, and led by your Holy Spirit, may we move forward with hope and trust, helping future generations to discover the “pearl of great price” which will bring them eternal life. And when time shall be no more, may our Diocese rejoice as the “mother of countless children”, and be given her place in heavenly glory. This we ask of you who live and reign for ever and ever. Amen. Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us. St Cuthbert, pray for us. Holy Martyrs of our Diocese, pray for us.

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
