**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
The word 'Lent' comes from an Old English word meaning 'lengthen' as through this dark time, the daylight hours will lengthen as the season of Spring, well, springs upon us. The word lent' for this season should then be a reminder that, whilst the next six weeks are a time of penitence in preparation for our great celebrations of the death and resurrection of Christ at Passiontide and Eastertide, they should be a joyful season, filled with hope, and disciplines of prayer, fasting and almsgiving, which draw us closer to Christ and to one another. Let's make the most of all the opportunities given to us in this Season – and make our joyful Eastertide even more joyful. This is the prayer of Thomas a Kempis that I read at the end my homily last week, which many people have asked for copies of: Grant me, O Lord, to know what I ought to know, To love what I ought to love, To praise what delights thee most, To value what is precious in thy sight, To hate what is offensive to thee. Do not suffer me to judge according to the sight of my eyes, Nor to pass sentence according to the hearing of the ears of ignorant men; But to discern with a true judgment between things visible and spiritual, And above all, always to inquire what is the good pleasure of thy will. Amen.

**First Reconciliation and Holy Communion:**  
The second session for Candidates is this Monday in the Hall at 6pm. Please pray for our young people as they continue their journeys of faith.

**Fr Peter's Lenten Challenge House Appeal:**  
as announced last week I am trying to raise £3000 to build a house (with lockable doors and windows) for a family with children with Albinism, to help save them from cruelty from within their own society, and abduction and torture from others. My challenge is to make a crafted cross (or two) every day during Lent. All donations are gratefully accepted, and envelopes are available at the back of Church. Please check out the pictures from Fr. Stephen in Malawi, and many thanks in anticipation.
