**Message from Father Peter:**  
As you know I am always keen to promote Patron Saints of various causes, and so on this Feast of All Saints I thought I might mention some of my regular favourite Patrons whom I’m always calling upon for intercession:   So first of all we have to mention St Anthony - Patron Saint of my car keys, which I can never find, and he always helps me as we all know he's Patron Saint of lost things, due to the story that when he was in charge of the young monks, he prayed that a monk who had absconded with a prayer book would return it, and apparently as the monk was running away he has an image of a monster or something which terrified him so much he ran back and returned the book. Believe me, St Anthony never fails.  The second century St Cecelia, who is buried in the catacombs in Rome, is Patron Saint of Music, as it is said that whilst being forced to marry a pagan she heard heavenly music guiding her to not participate in the service. She is often pictured playing the organ - which wasn't invented till centuries later. Her feast day is November 22nd (also the birthday of one of my favourite composers, Benjamin Britten who wrote an 'Ode to St. Cecelia').  Tobias will be pleased that I mention the seventh century Abbess St. Gertrude, who was apparently known for ridding her Abbey of mice and rats, which is possibly, or possibly not, a metaphor, but either way for this is Patron Saint of Cats and Cat Lovers. In interests of equality, I should tell you that St Roch, whose sores were licked by dogs, is Patron of those other four legged friends.  And over the summer, with the help of Wendy at SJ's and Martin at SP's I've been trying to improve my fitness, and the Patron Saint of Physical Fitness, Gyms and Bodybuilding is St Hyacinth of Poland, who despite his name is a man (it sounds better in Polish as my mate Ed explained). He received this Patronage because when pagans were burning down his church he ran in and rescued the Blessed Sacrament, and as he was leaving he heard a voice saying, 'What about me?' He recognised the voice as being that of Our Lady; he turned round and there was a huge stone statue, and with supernatural strength he was able to take the statue in his arms and rescue it from the burning church. He is pictured with the Monstrance in one hand and a huge statue of Our Lady in his other arm, and is one of the Patron Saints of Poland (indeed the BSL sign for Poland refers to this).  And let's not forget Isadore of Seville, Patron Saint of the Internet, because he had a huge library and was known as the 'preserver of knowledge'. A good Saint to help us keep the internet safe for us all, especially our young, and useful to call upon when the WiFi goes down…  This prayer can be used to insert your own Patron Saint and their cause: Glorious Saint (Name of the Patron Saint), you served God in humility and confidence on earth. Now you enjoy His beatific vision in heaven. You persevered till death and gained the crown of eternal life. Remember now the dangers and confusion and anguish that surround me and intercede for me in my needs and troubles, especially (and mention the situation you are praying for here). Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
