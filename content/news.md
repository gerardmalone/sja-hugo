**Message from Father Peter:**  
Well it has been a lovely start to the Academic Year, and SJSP’s has played a great part in ensuring our children’s school year is firmly in the hands of our Blessed Lord, and his Mother, Mary. At SP’s we celebrated a Mass with Year 7 of St. Bede’s in the First Week at their new school, and the following week the whole of Our own School St. Peter’s, came into SP’s for a mass to celebrate the New Year. Last Thursday at SJ’s every Catholic school in the Fylde was represented at a special Mass celebrating the Jubilee Year, the Centenary of the Diocese, and to finally place the Statue of Our lady, which has been travelling round the diocese, into it’s final destination in one of our Schools. A couple of hundred children sang beautiful hymns to Our Lady, and I talked about the importance of looking up at these beautiful images we have in our Churches of the Saints and of our Blessed Mother, to help us on our journeys to Her Son. There is so much evangelization needed in the world, and in our own Diocese and Parishes, and our Schools play a huge part in that evangelization, but also as places, and conduits for us to share our faith and pass it on to our children. As well as thanking all who work in our schools, as well as our young people, and their parents, and our indefatigable Children’s Liturgy and sacrament teams, we should especially also give thanks to those who enable our children’s celebrations, in front and behind the scenes, those who prepare the sacristies and corral our Altar Servers, and provide music, as well as organizing these services in the first place – often at incredibly short notice, and coping with the unexpected. And huge thanks to everyone who personally supports me in this mission – especially when I cannot give them a clue as to what is actually going to happen! The mission to our children and their families, especially when we do not see them regularly at Church is vital, not only for the future of the Church, but as a significant response to the call of Christ to us and from us all. Let us make our Churches welcoming spaces – but also go out to where those children are, just as Christ went to the people wherever they were, and rejoicing in our God given gift to pass on the faith, which we have been graced to receive ourselves. Dear Lord, together we pray for our children. May they experience the joy of faith, the hope of the ‘Good News’ of Jesus and the love that comes from knowing the Lord’s great love for each one of us. May they grow in faith so that we all walk together as Your children, in peace and love. Help us to be better missionaries to them through our prayers, our work, and our example. Through Christ our Lord.

**Red Mission Boxes:**  
The Autumn collection from the boxes commences this week. Please would you bring your box to church and leave in the sacristy [make sure your name is on the box] The boxes will be returned to the sacristy after emptying. If you would like a box, please contact David Warwick on the number in this weeks [bulletin]([https://st-josephsansdell.net/bulletins).  

**The Church Grounds:**  
Fr. Peter has asked me to organise a group of willing volunteers to take care of the planted borders at St. Joseph’s. The lawns and hedging are looked after privately. If you are willing and able to help out for an hour or two each month - probably less over winter after an initial tidy up, then please email me at [pat52benning@gmail.com](mailto:pat52benning@gmail.com).  As ever, the more people who can commit, the less onerous the workload. Once I have names and mobile numbers, I’ll organise a get together. We have a beautiful church, let’s keep the gardens beautiful too. Thank you in anticipation. Pat. (And thanks from FrP., too)

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska
