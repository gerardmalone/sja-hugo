**Statement from the Catholic Diocese of Lancaster upon the death of our Holy Father Pope Francis.**  
It is with great sadness that we learned this morning of the death of our Holy Father, Pope Francis, following a period of ill-health. Yesterday, on Easter Sunday, Pope Francis made a brief appearance at St Peter's Square to bless thousands of people gathered in Rome to celebrate the Resurrection of the Lord. May he now rest in the peace of the Risen Christ whose faithful servant he has been. We are deeply grateful for the life and service of Pope Francis. While we mourn his loss, we are thankful for his steadfast witness and legacy. His life of discipleship, and then leadership, within the Church saw him accept responsibility from the Lord as a Jesuit, a priest, a bishop, and finally as successor to St Peter. His firm resolve and challenging teaching on issues including care for creation, the sexual abuse of children, and insights into intimacy of human relationships, saw the Pope broaden opportunities for dialogue within the church, and with people and groups from outside of the Catholic Church. Masses for the repose of the Pope's soul will be offered across the churches of our Diocese in the coming days. We entrust Pope Francis to the Father of all mercies and pray for the happy repose of his soul. Please remember Pope Francis in your prayers. An announcement will follow in due course regarding a diocesan mass in the cathedral, to which ecumenical and civic guests will be invited. O God, for whom the just receive an unfailing reward, grant that your servant, Francis, our Pope, whom you made vicar of Peter and shepherd of your Church, may rejoice for ever in the vision of your glory, for he was a faithful steward here on earth of the mysteries of your forgiveness and grace. Though Christ our Lord.

***We will celebrate a Requiem Mass for Pope Francis on Tuesday evening at 7pm. All Welcome.***  

**Prayer of Entrustment to Divine Mercy:**  
O Lord, our God. We place our trust in You, because you are mercy itself. We repent of our sins and turn to You for mercy. We trust You to provide for our every need, according to Your will. Help us to forgive others as You forgive us. We promise to be merciful by our deeds, words and prayers. Though we have fears because of human weakness, we rely on Your infinite goodness and mercy. We entrust to You the future of our planet, our Church, our nations, our families and all our needs. With loud cries we implore your mercy on us
and on the whole world. Look upon us, created in your image and likeness. Form us in the Heart of Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit into the living images of mercy. May all come to know the depth of Your mercy and sing the praises of Your mercy forever. Amen!
