**Father Peter's Lenten Challenge 2025:**  
Over Lent I would like to try and raise £3000 to build a house in Malawi for a family with children afflicted with albinism. To this end I will be pledging to make a number of crafted crosses. I'll explain more this weekend and watch this space. Envelopes are available for any donations at the back of Church. Many thanks in anticipation.  

**Trinity Hospice:**  
Our 2025 Appeal for Trinity Hospice and Brian House Children's Hospice has raised an incredible £2,701.83 (including Gift Aid). We would like to say a sincere 'Thank You' to everyone who has donated to this deserving cause. We hope to arrange a formal cheque presentation at an upcoming parish social event.  

**Refurbishment of Bell Ringing Ropes:**  
In order to keep our wonderful bells ringing, in March we will be sending our ropes to Ellis' in Loughborough to have part of the rope replaced with polyhemp. The benefits of this include good resistance to abrasion and rotting. This work has recently become necessary due to some our ropes snapping and showing significant signs of wear. If you would like to contribute towards the cost of this work, ropes are available for sponsorship, the cost being £50 per rope. A record of the dedication would be displayed within the ringing room. Please contact James and Stacey (number in this weeks [bulletin](/bulletins)). Thank you.

**Fr Steven (Malawi) and Fr Victor (Turkana, Kenya)**  
have asked pass on their sincere thanks for the welcome, interest and generosity that they received when they visited both churches last weekend. They also can't thank us enough for the generosity of last year when enough funds were raised for the four fishing boats that have made such a difference to four families in Turkana. They wished that they could have spent more time with us but duty called elsewhere in London, Norway and Spain - but to name a few. They look forward to visiting again next year but in the meantime if anyone wants more information about their missionary work get in touch with Pete and Pat Benning through Fr Peter.
