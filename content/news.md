## Message from Father Peter

Last week in St. Bernadette’s in Lancaster, his final Parish before retirement, the requiem Mass of our dear friend Father Peter Foulkes was celebrated by Bishop Paul. The night before his mortal remains were brought into his house in Lytham, and with a group of Peter’s friends, and Fr. Peter’s brother, Fr. John, the Bishop and I celebrated a lovely peaceful mass for him. During the requiem itself, myself, Fr. John and Deacon Michael watched the live stream together and celebrated the requiem mass simultaneously. It was a beautiful mass, with the music led by Fr. Peter’s friends from the days he ran the Liturgy Centre of the Diocese at St. Augustine’s Preston. It was during his years here that Fr. Peter ran many courses for the Diocese in how we can best celebrate the wonderful liturgies of the Church, and share their beauty and meaning, giving Glory to God in Word and action, and making every gathering a true celebration. It was here, many years ago when I was a Deacon at St. Kentigern’s, that Fr. Peter gave me lessons in how to say mass! And even when I came to SJSP after my first Mass at SP’s Fr. Peter immediately remarked how glad he was that I didn’t use a bookstand on the altar, as, he said, ‘Nothing should stand between the people and the Eucharist’. Now reaching his eternal reward there is indeed nothing standing between Fr. Peter and Christ himself. It was a privilege to have had such a wonderful priest in all of our lives, and may his long years of ministry be duly rewarded.

Hear with favour our prayers, which we humbly offer, O Lord, for the salvation of the soul of Peter, your servant and Priest, that he, who devoted a faithful ministry to your name, may rejoice in the perpetual company of your Saints. Through our Lord, Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.

## 2026 Lenten Challenge

I always like a Lenten Challenge to raise money for a great cause. This year, it was thought we could make it a Kirkham Deanery effort to change children’s lives by raising money to send them to a school in Malawi, run by the community. It costs just £300 for a child’s education, board and lodging for a whole year, and it would be great to send as many children to build up the school as we can.

To this end I will be making 1000 Origami Paper Cranes — an international symbol of hope and peace. Our Primary and Secondary Schools are joining us in this great endeavour. If you would like to help us, please see the poster in the Church and Schools, use the QR code to gift if possible, or pass on enveloped donations at the back of Church. And also check out the Paper Cranes at SJ’s and SP’s. Many thanks in anticipation for your support.
