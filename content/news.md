**Message from Father Peter:**  
August is the Month of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. And fittingly in the middle of the month, this coming Friday, we celebrate the lovely Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. One of my favourite Marian Devotions, which was introduced to me by a Parishioner from my old stamping ground of St. Bernadette’s a few years ago, during a particular trying time, was ‘Our Lady, Untier of Knots’. As long ago as the second century the great St. Irenaeus told us that, ‘the knot of Eve’s disobedience was untied by the obedience of Mary’, but it wasn’t until the eighteenth century, in Germany that the first well known painting of Mary Untier of Knots was created, in response to a German couple who had asked Our Lady to untie the difficulties and knots in their marriage. They brought a knotted ribbon from their wedding and placed it on Our Lady’s Altar - which was miraculously untied, as a symbol of their prayers being answered. In the second half of the last century this devotion spread, with the first chapel named as such in Austria in 1989, following the disaster at Chernobyl of April 1986; the devotion was popular in Argentina, and was perhaps brought to greater world wide conscious with Pope Francis who, as a Cardinal distributed pictures of the Icon, and had this image of Mary engraved on a Chalice which he presented to Pope Benedict – and he himself received a similar chalice from the people of Argentine when he became Pope. The lovely image and devotion just reminds us that through the intercession of Mary, through the unique closeness she shares with her son Jesus, any difficulties, any ‘knots’ in our lives, can be unravelled and solved – just as she asked her Son to solve the problem of the lack of wine at a wedding in Cana. I was able to buy a little statue of the image when I was in Lourdes earlier this year, which seemed fitting after knotting lots of crosses during Lent, and I’ve put an image of the devotion on the Lady Altar of each Church. There’s a whole Novena to the devotion, and here is an excerpt of Pope Francis’ Prayer: Holy Mary, full of God’s presence during the days of your life, you accepted with full humility the Father’s will. Once with your Son you interceded for our difficulties, and full of kindness and patience, you gave us example of how to untie the knots in our life. By remaining forever Our Mother, you put in order and make more clear the ties that link us to the Lord. Holy Mother, Mother of God and our Mother, untie with a motherly heart the knots of our life, that prevent us from being united with God, so that we, free from sin and error, may find Him in all things, may have our hearts placed in Him, and may serve Him always in our brothers and sisters. Amen.

**School Stuff:**  
Once again I am making my August Appeal to you for stationery items - pens, pencils, pencil cases, school bags whatever, for those children who might need a little help with their supplies for the new school year. I’d also add this a plea for ‘scientific calculators’ ‘and geometry kits’ for a Catholic Secondary School I am in contact with, who would greatly appreciate them. There is a box at the back of Church, and please be assured that all donations will go to those most in need. Many thanks in anticipation. (I’ll be blessing backpacks for the New Year on Sunday 7th).

**Burkina Faso:**  
our annual appeal is now open and envelopes for donations are available at the back of church which can be returned via the offertory collection. The appeal will remain open until 7 September. E.Gillett
