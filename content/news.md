**Message from Father Peter:**  
In the light of the attack on the Jewish worshippers in Manchester, as well as the Catholic worshipers in America but a month ago, I asked last week before Masses that we all pray for all victims of intolerance and hatred, and several people asked for copies of the prayer I read out. I took for the main part of the prayer words from Pope John XXIII, whose Feast Day it is on October 11th. Pope John had served as a Military Chaplain in World War I, so knew first-hand the ravages of war and hatred, before being elected Pope in 1958, serving the Church in his Papacy for five years, during which, shortly before his death, he opened the Second Vatican Council. Working for peace was one of Pope John’s life missions. In his very first Papal Address he called for reconciliation between Christians, and for world peace, and later called for human freedom and dignity as the basis for world order and peace in his encyclical ‘Mater et Magistra’. He was canonized alongside Saint John Paul II in 2014 by Pope Francis. His prayerful words are perhaps needed more than ever:  *Lord Jesus Christ, who are called the Prince of Peace, who are yourself our peace and reconciliation, who so often said, "Peace to you," grant us peace, religious freedom, and tolerance.  Make all men and women witnesses of truth, justice, and brotherly love. Banish from their hearts whatever might endanger peace. Replace stoney hearts with hearts of love and openness.  Enlighten our rulers that they may guarantee and defend the great gift of peace and freedom to worship openly and honestly.  May all peoples of the earth become as brothers and sisters. May longed-for peace blossom forth and reign always over us all. Amen.*  

**Fr. Peter Hart:**  
Please note that while Fr. Peter Hart is in Hospital and recovering from his Operation, I will be covering the 5pm Mass at Star of the Sea, so will not be around to welcome for the 6pm, and apologies for any breathlessness at the evening celebration! Please pray for Fr. Peter that he continues to make an excellent recovery.  

**Diocesan Centenary Mass:**  
This Saturday In Lancaster cathedral the Bishop will celebrate the Official Diocesan Centenary Mass (which as you know is ticket only).  
Please pray the Diocesan Centenary Prayer:  *God our Father, we thank you for all the graces and blessings You have bestowed on our Diocese since its foundation one hundred years ago on ground made fertile by the blood of the martyrs.  Nourished by your Son, Jesus Christ, in Word and Sacraments, and led by your Holy Spirit, may we move forward with hope and trust, helping future generations to discover the “pearl of great price” which will bring them eternal life.  And when time shall be no more, may our Diocese rejoice as the “mother of countless children”, and be given her place in heavenly glory.  This we ask of you who live and reign for ever and ever. Amen. Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us. St Cuthbert, pray for us. Holy Martyrs of our Diocese, pray for us.*

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
