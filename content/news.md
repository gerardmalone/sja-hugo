**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.  

**Email Address:**  
The Diocese is changing all email addresses. The one email for our two parishes is now [sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk](mailto:sjsp.lsa@lrcd.org.uk). Please do whatever you have to do to use this email from now on. Cheers.  

**Hospital:**  
Please remember to let us know if you or one of your family is being admitted to hospital.  

**Coffee & Bacon Butties:**  
Will be available in the church hall after the 9:15am Mass. Why not come and enjoy a chat.  

**St Joseph’s Care:**  
Do you know of anyone in our community who is in need or might need a little more support? Company or just someone to talk to? Someone who may, at times, need help with things? Please let us know and we can contact them. Or you can give them our St Joseph’s Care phone number so they can contact us: Tel: 07840112265.  

**St Joseph’s Facebook Page:**  
We now have over 300 people regularly following us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Josephs-Roman-Catholic-Church-Ansdell/230000653837017) which is allowing us to reach out to those in the wider community and fulfill our parish commitment to evangelization. In the last couple of months, we have been able to help a number of people who have sought assistance through this medium.
