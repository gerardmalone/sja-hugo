**Message from Father Peter:**  
I mentioned in my Christmas Sermon that I always listen to Handel’s ‘Messiah’ around Christmas. Well around Epiphany I always listen to ‘Amahl and the Night Visitors’, Gian Carlo Menotti’s children’s opera, based on Italian folk tales of the Nativity and Epiphany, which is a retelling of the story of the Three Wise Men from the point of view of a young disabled boy named Amahl, who lives in poverty with his widowed mother near Bethlehem. He sees a bright star in the sky one night and tells his mother to go and look, but she brushes him off, as he is always making up stories, and she is more concerned over their poverty, and whether they are going to be able to support themselves in the coming year. That night, to Amahl’s mother’s amazement, three kings come across their falling down hut and seek shelter, having travelled for hundreds of miles, following the star, which Amahl’s mother had not believed in. They bring with them gifts to give to ‘the Child’ who has just been born and who will reign over all. Amahl’s mother, in her desperation tries to steal just a bit of the treasure, thinking of what it could do for her disabled son, but is caught red-handed. The three Kings are understanding of the Mother’s temptation, and tell her she can keep the gold because ‘The child we seek doesn’t need our gold. On love, on love alone he will build his kingdom. His pierced hand will hold no sceptre. His haloed head will wear no crown. He will bring us new life, and receive our death, and the keys to his city belong to the poor. The Mother realises that this is the kind of King that she and the whole world are waiting for, and she hands back the gold. Amahl decides that he wants to give the new born a gift, so offers the only thing he has, his crutch. And he as he hands it over to the Kings to give to the child, he is miraculously cured. ‘He walks! It is a sign from the holy child. We must give praise to the newborn king. This is a sign from God. Truly he can dance, he can jump, he can run! Amahl’s mother allows him to go with the Kings to present the crutch himself, and as Amahl and the three night visitors set out across the darkened land, they hear the sounds of shepherds singing, ‘All the stars have left the sky. Sweet dawn - oh dawn of peace. Because peace and healing has indeed truly dawned. Lovely story, and a lovely little opera for this week’s feast. (You can catch the whole thing on the YouTube). May God bless us with the gifts of faith and perseverance this Epiphany and throughout the whole of the New Year.
