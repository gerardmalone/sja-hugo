**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
Well what a wonderful Advent and Christmas it has been, with beautiful liturgies leading us into the new Year. And the Liturgical Calendar doesn’t stop, indeed the first weeks of Christmastide are some of the busiest in the year. Today we celebrate the Feast of the Holy Family – which is always celebrated on the Sunday during the Octave, the eight days, of Christmas. Monday is the Feast of St. Thomas Becket, the Patron of Clergy in Parishes in England and Wales. He was famously ‘murdered in the Cathedral’ – and the film of TS Eliot’s play about Thomas is well worth watching. Thomas was born in London in 1118. He was Chancellor of England and in 1162 became Archbishop of Canterbury. He defended the position of the Church against King Henry II, and was exiled to France for six years. He had further trials when he returned and was murdered in 1170 in Canterbury Cathedral by the King's men. On Thursday 1st we celebrate the wonderful Feast of Mary. Mother of God, and place our whole Calednar year under her Patronage. And on Friday 2nd we celebrate Saints Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzen, two great saints of the early Church. Basil was born in 330 and at forty became the Bishop of Caesarea, after spending a number of years as a hermit. He wrote much of value, especially the monastic rules, many of which are still followed by the monks of the Eastern Church. He was outstanding in helping the poor. Gregory was born in the same year and joined Basil in undertaking a life of solitude. In 381 he became Bishop of Constantinople. He was a man of great wisdom and eloquence. And that takes us to the weekend, the Epiphany on Tuesday 6th, the Baptism of the Lord the following Sunday. The wonderful liturgical Pageant continues in our Happy new Year!
