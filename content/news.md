**Message from Fr. Peter:**  
A couple of weeks ago, St. John’s Gospel told us about the third resurrection appearance to the Apostles – where he asked Peter three times ‘Do you love me?’ This was preceded by the Apostles having spent the night fishing and caught nothing, until Jesus appeared and encouraged them to try again, at which they caught a full net of fish – 153 of them. 153 is a very definite number to mention, and it sent me on a chase to figure out why that exact number should be mentioned. Well over the past couple of thousand years scholars have been chasing an explanation, too, and whilst there is no consensus on the why there should be this number, there are a number of suggested explanations. Some explanations focus on Hebrew words having numerical equivalents, which mean that 153 could be read as ‘I AM GOD’ or something or other, but other scholars completely debunk this. Numerologically wise, number 153 is equal to adding the first seventeen digits or 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17. 153 is also the product of 9 x 17. If we add the individual digits (1 + 5 + 3) we end up with 9. If we add the cube of each of the individual digits (1 x 1 x 1) + (5 x 5 x 5) + (3 x 3 x 3), the result is 1 plus 125 plus 27 or 153. (I don’t understand any of that, so please don’t ask me). Apparently if you add up the number of personal blessings that Jesus gives in the four Gospels it comes to 153 (I haven’t verified this). St Louise de Montfort connects the catch of 153 fish with the number of [Hail Marys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary) said (3 plus 15 sets of 10) in the whole Rosary. There are heaps of other suggestions, but my favourite explanation comes from the Patron Saint of Bible Scholars, St. Jerome. He suggested that it was believed that there were 153 species of fish, and so the number symbolised all the different peoples of the world being welcomed into the one fishing net of the Holy Church, the peoples of which the Apostles were to be the ‘fishers of men’. Let’s ensure that our churches and our parishes are truly welcoming to all peoples, so that, like the net of the Apostles in the Gospels, our Churches might overflow with God’s wonderful catch of people.

*The Benemerenti Medal was first given by Pope Pius VI as a military award for soldiers. Under Pope Gregory XVI (1831–1846) a special Benemerenti medal was created to reward those who fought courageously in the Papal army at Ferrara, Bologna, and Vienna. In 1925, under Pope Pius XI, this medal began to be awarded to civil, military, laity and clergy, in recognition of exceptional service to the Catholic Church.*

**From Pope Leo’s First Sunday Message:**  
Dear brothers and sisters, happy Sunday! Today brothers and sisters, I have the joy of praying with you and all the People of God for vocations, especially those to the priesthood and consecrated life. The Church has such a great need for them! It is important that young men and women on their vocational journey find acceptance, listening and encouragement in their communities, and that they can look up to credible models of generous dedication to God and to their brothers and sisters. Let us take up the invitation that Pope Francis left us in his Message for today: the invitation to welcome and accompany young people. And let us ask our heavenly Father to assist us in living in service to one another, each according to his or her state of life, shepherds after his own heart capable of helping one another to walk in love and truth. And to young people, I say: “Do not be afraid! Accept the invitation of the Church and of Christ the Lord!” May the Virgin Mary, whose entire life was a response to the Lord’s call, always accompany us in following Jesus.  

**Fr Peter’s Lenten Challenge House Appeal:**  
Dear friends at St Joseph’s, St Peter’s and St Bernadette’s, After our visit to you in February, when we came to thank you for raising the money for three fishing boats, I was amazed to hear that Fr Peter had set a new Lenten challenge to raise £3000 to build a house for an albino family here in Malawi. I was also very touched as the need only came up in a conversation over a coffee! On Easter Sunday I received a video of Fr Peter announcing at Mass that you had donated over £8K and likely to reach £9K – enough for three houses! I was speechless and It took me a few minutes for it to register. The news came when I was with colleagues and we celebrated your generosity, fellowship and compassion. Three very vulnerable families in bad situations are going to benefit immensely from your kindness – I cannot tell you how grateful we are. I will write again with an update and pictures of the houses being constructed. In the meantime, I pray for you all and for your wonderful charity and I look forward to seeing you all again next year when we come to stay with our friends. Love and prayers, Fr Steven, Missionary Community of St Paul the Apostle. (MCSPA)
