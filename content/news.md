## Message from Father Peter

So how is Lent going? After our first Celebration of the Stations of the Cross at SP’s on Monday I remarked that now it truly does feel like Lent (by that stage it had only been five days without Pringles, so I’m still coping). The word ‘Lent’ actually comes from old English – via Europe – meaning ‘the Season of Spring’ which in turn comes from ‘lengthening of days’ and indeed throughout this season the days are getting brighter, and the clocks will go forward on the weekend of Palm Sunday. The Forty days of Lent of course correspond to the forty days Christ spent in the desert being tempted by the Devil, as we heard in the Gospel last week, and indeed always do on the First Sunday of Lent. But this also links us back to the Old Testament: Moses fasted for forty days and nights before he was presented with the Ten Commandments, and the Prophet Elijah did the same before he had his great Theophany, his encounter with God, on Mount Horeb. We also link the days of Lent to the Forty Years that the Israelites spent in the Wilderness, journeying to the Promised Land, totally dependent on the guidance – materially and spiritually of God. In the story of Jonah (and the Whale) the people of Nineveh were given forty days to make the repentance before God. Some traditions work out that Christ was in the tomb for forty hours - from Friday Evening to Sunday Morning (not three consecutive twenty-four hours, which incidentally would make seventy-two hours, which would correspond to the hours Jonah spent in the belly of the whale). Anyway, we begin the second week of Lent, so let’s make sure we make the best of these forty days - and continue, or begin, or recommit - ourselves to our disciplines of Prayer, Fasting and Abstinence. Perhaps we might take the opportunity to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. The ‘Anima Christi’ makes a beautiful and appropriate prayer for this, or any, season: Soul of Christ, sanctify me; Body of Christ, save me; Blood of Christ, inebriate me; Water from Christ’s side, wash me; Passion of Christ, strengthen me; O good Jesus, hear me; Within Thy wounds hide me; Suffer me not to be separated from Thee; From the malicious enemy defend me; In the hour of my death call me; And bid me come unto Thee; That I may praise Thee with Thy saints and with Thy angels; Forever and ever. Amen.

## Congratulations to Catechumens

Rhys and Liam, and Candidates Janos, Csanad, Alan and James who were presented to the Bishop last Saturday in the Cathedral in Lancaster at the Rite of Election in preparation to be received into Full Communion with the Church at Easter. Please pray for them as they make this great step in their faith journey.

## 2026 Lenten Challenge: 

I always like a Lenten Challenge to raise money for a great cause, this year, it was thought we could make it a Kirkham Deanery effort to change children’s lives by raising money to send them to a school in Malawi, run by the community. It costs just £300 for a child’s education, board and lodging for a whole year, and it would be great to send as many children to build up the school as we can. To this end I will be making 1000 Origami Paper Cranes – an international symbol of hope and peace. Our Primary and Secondary Schools are joining us in this great endeavour. If you would like to help us, please see the poster in the Church and Schools, use the QR code to gift if possible, or pass on enveloped donations at the back of Church. And also check out the Paper Cranes at SJ’s and SP’s. Many thanks in anticipation for your support.
