**Message from Father Peter:**  
This Friday 11th we celebrate the Feast of St. Benedict, one of the Patron Saints of Europe, and known as the ‘Father of Western Monasticism’. Born around 480AD to a wealthy family, Benedict was drawn to the ascetic life of a hermit, high in the mountains, away from the debauchery of Rome. Other people seeking a similar life were drawn to him, and this led to the building of the famous monastery at Monte Cassino, where the monks, as today, lived a life of prayer, work, and study, as well as hospitality to others, all under the ‘Rule of St. Benedict’ which he wrote towards the end of his life. Whether drawn to the monastic life or not (and I’m definitely not), the ‘Rule’ is still a great read, and hugely appropriate to this day and age, perhaps more than ever, in its call to work for the common good, to have respect for all peoples, and a sense of hospitality and welcome to all, all combined with ‘moderation in all things’, as well as the two fold Christianity identities of work and prayer for the Lord – along with an emphasis on scriptural and ecclesiastical study, and finally reminding us that the rule is only ‘a beginning to perfection’. I actually read the rule just last night (it’s not a huge tome), in a new modern, translation (which I downloaded on to my Kindle), and was wryly struck at how it suggests a way of life and ideas for living which so many modern ‘self-help’ books regularly promote as something new to the twenty-first century - it’s fifteen hundred years old! This is Benedict’s prayer: O gracious and holy God, Give us wisdom to know you, Intelligence to understand you, Diligence to seek you, Patience to wait for you, Eyes to behold you, A heart to meditate upon you, A life to proclaim you. To the power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, May we see the face of Christ in others. May we listen to others with the ear of our heart. Amen. Incidentally, I wanted to be a Gregorian monk, but I never got the chants. I’ll get my coat, and my habit...  

**First Week of the Month at SJSP’s.**  
Monday 7th July: Evening Prayer and Benediction at St. Joseph’s at 7pm.

**Prayer for Peace:**  
many thanks to everyone who - at incredibly short notice - advertised, heard about, and then attended the Rosary and Benediction for Peace a couple of weeks ago at SP’s. It was a very special Holy Hour, and it is suggested we might make this a monthly event – in the third week of the month, complementing our Vespers on the first week? What do you think? Please let me know.

**The Rule of St. Benedict:**  
I’ve already been asked to add, further to the ‘message’ overleaf, that the version of ‘The Rule’ that I read last night was a new modern translation by Peter Northcutt. There are other Spiritual Classics in this series, and I will report on them at a later date.  

**Fylde Rugby Club:**  
there has been a planning application from Fylde Rugby which I was asked to look over as a concerned party. I’ve had it checked it out by a competent authority (not me), and the work at the back of their buildings should not affect us. Thank you for the help!  

**Wedding Anniversary Mass:**  
Sat 12 July, 12.15pm Lancaster Cathedral. Bishop Paul invites all couples in the Diocese celebrating milestone wedding anniversaries this year - to a Mass of celebration and blessing.
