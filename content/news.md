**Message from Father Peter:**  
Amid the 80th celebrations of VJ day the other week let's remember that Friday 23rd August was the 81st Anniversary of the Freckleton Air Disaster. Until I was sent there as Parish Priest in 2004 I didn't know the history of the village, which the then Parish Priest told me of when I went to visit the Parish for the first time. 'You always have to remember,' he said, 'Freckleton is a village in mourning.' On 23 August 1944 an American aeroplane from the airbase in Warton took off in bad weather, and crashed into the centre of the village of Freckleton, into Holy Trinity Church of England School, demolishing three houses and the Sad Sack Snack Bar. The death toll was 61, including 38 children about their ordinary school day. I was present for the sixtieth anniversary of the disaster and got to know people who had lost brothers and sisters whom they never knew, people who still felt guilty that they were not at school that day, people who were at school and have lived with what we now call PTSD all their lives, and also families of the American airmen, who were still in touch with families in the village. Somebody once said to me on VE day that he didn't know why he had no memories of VE Day, until it occurred to him that there had been no celebrations in Freckleton, there was too much to mourn. Each year after the 'Club Day' procession, everyone goes to the children's grave to say a prayer. On the sixtieth anniversary I led the prayers, and I ask you to pray it this weekend: God our heavenly Father, Source and destiny of our lives, In your loving providence you give us life, children and generations, To grow in wisdom, age and grace. Eighty-One years ago, you called these children to yourself, When they were suddenly, and violently taken from us. As we continue to grieve the loss of ones so young, We seek to understand your purpose. Having drawn these children to yourself, We are confident you have given them full stature in Jesus Christ. May they stand with the all the angels and the saints, Who know you love and praise your saving will. Continue to comfort and bring new life to this village. Be our refuge and strength O Lord And lift us from the vestiges of sadness Into the peace and light of your presence. Through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.  

**School Stuff:**  
Huge thanks for the response for Stationary for a School Children, including all the 'scientific calculators' and tinned 'geometry sets' for a Secondary School I am in contact with, who would greatly appreciate them. I'll leave the box at the back for another week, and please be assured that all donations will go to those most in need. Many thanks in anticipation. (I'll be blessing backpacks for the New Year on Sunday 7th).  

**Burkina Faso:**  
Thank you for the generous donations of £980.76 so far. The appeal remains open for one more month. Envelopes for donations are available at the back of church which can be returned via the offertory collection. E.Gillett  

**Correction!!!**  
Last week in the Message I said Blessed Edward Bamber's hand is at Stonyhurst. My Deacons pointed out that his hand actually resides in the Church of St. Oswald and St. Edmund in Ashton in Makerfield, indeed Deacon Michael has actually held his hand. Stonyhurst holds his vestments and priestly equipment. The relics of Edmund and Padre Pio will be in front of the Altar at St. Peter's this week.
