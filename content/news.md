## 12th January 2025

**Message from Father Peter:**  
Every first Monday of the Month we now have Vespers in one of our Churches on our timetable, and it’s wonderful to see a lovely group of people each month celebrating the psalms together and adoring the Blessed Sacrament in Benediction. Each month we use the official Church dedication of the month for our theme, and January is dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus. The Angel Gabriel told Mary at the Annunciation that. ‘You must name him Jesus’, which means ‘God is with us’, and St. Paul described the name of Jesus as ‘the name above all names’, with the Acts of the Apostles recording that the first miracles of the early Church were made ‘in the name of Jesus’. But an actual devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus actually only began in the 12th Century, and was spread in the 15th Century when the Cistercian Monk, St. Bernadine of Siena in Italy, encouraged devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus to bring peace to families, towns and states, and for people to make this a very publication declaration by putting on the door posts the first three Greek letters of Jesus; name, ‘IHS’. January 3rd is actually the memorial of ‘the Holy name of Jesus’. This is a 19th century prayer in reparation for blasphemous use Jesus’ name. *May the most holy, most sacred, most adorable, most mysterious and unutterable Name of God be always praised, blessed, loved, adored and glorified in heaven on earth and under the earth, by all the creatures of God, and by the Sacred Heart of our Lord Jesus Christ in the most Holy Sacrament of the altar. Amen.*  

**This Week’s Liturgical Calendar:**
Monday 13th: St. Kentigern, a sixth century Saint, the founder and Patron of Glasgow, and Patron Saint of those accused of Infidelity, and those who are being bullied; Friday 17th St. Anthony of Egypt, a third century hermit, who is Patron Saint of those afflicted with skin diseases (not to be confused with St. Anthony of Padua who is the Patron saint of lost things).  

**A Prayer of thanksgiving for our Baptism:**
We thank You, Lord God, that You have blessed us with this powerful, precious gift. We ask for Your gracious help, that You would strengthen and confirm the faith You have granted, and we have expressed in our baptism. Help us to renew ourselves to a full-scale demonstration of the new life you have accomplished for us in Christ and applied to us by the Holy Spirit. Nurture a true unity among us because of the common baptism we share. Amen.  

**School Mass:**

**Year of Jubilee 2025.**
As Bishop Paul explained in last week’s Pastoral Letter Pope Francis has begun a Year of Jubilee for 2025 by opening the Holy Doors in St Peter’s Basilica and in the Arch-Basilica of St John Lateran, the Cathedral of Rome. These Jubilee Years have been announced by popes every twenty five years since 1300 AD and the theme of this Jubilee is hope. Pope Francis has published a Bull of Indiction – an official document to proclaim the Jubilee. It is entitled Spes Non Confundit ‘Hope does not disappoint’ (Rom 5:5). You can download a pdf of the document, in which the pope speaks about the themes of the Jubilee at [here](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/20240509_spes-non-confundit_bolla-giubileo2025.pdf)
