**Message from Father Peter:**  
This Thursday we celebrate a Feast Proper to England and Wales, for Saint John Henry Newman, the most recent of English Saints, being Canonised by Pope Francis on 13th October just six years ago (I’m counting Carlo Acutis as an Italian, though he was born in England). Saint John Henry was born on February 21st, 1801, into a Church going Anglican family. His family were not overly religious, but John Henry developed an interest in the Bible, and when he went to study at Trinity College in Oxford, and eventually was ordained as an Anglican Minister. Both in England and the English Church there was a lot going on, which caused John Henry to question his vocation, and his Anglicanism, and after withdrawing from the world for three years and living a strict ascetic religious life, he was drawn to the Catholic Church and received into full communion on the 9th October 1845, by the Italian Passionist Priest, Blessed Dominic Barbari. Ostracised by family and friends because of his new-found faith, John Henry went to study in Rome, eventually being ordained priest. He founded two Oratorian Communities upon his return to England, in London and Birmingham, before, at the behest of the Bishops of Ireland, becoming the first Rector of the first University for Catholic Students, what is now University College Dublin. He was made Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII in 1879, dying eleven years later. As well as all the ministries in his life which I’ve mentioned, he was also a great writer and scholar – his writing is absolutely beautiful, and I always say that his poem ‘The Dream of Gerontius’ which tells of the dying moments of a man and his subsequent entry into eternal life, is the best explanation of Purgatory that there is (it was famously set to music by Edward Elgar, and also includes the hymn ‘Firmly I Believe and Truly’ which we still sometimes sing). Newman did much to make Catholicism acceptable in England, at a time when Catholic loyalty to Queen and Country was still being strongly questioned. St. John Henry’s life involved a great deal of change, and one of his phrases was, ‘To live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often’. This is one of his most beautiful prayers: May the Lord support us all the day long, Till the shades lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done. Then in his mercy may he give us a safe lodging, and holy rest, and peace at the last. Amen.

**Have you heard of Mothers Prayers?**  
The “Mothers Prayers” movement started in England in November 1995 and has spread rapidly throughout the world with contacts in over 100 Countries and has the approval, support and blessing of Christian leaders of all denominations. There are now thousands of groups around the world. For many years there has been an active Mothers Prayers group at Our Lady Star of the Sea and recently a new group started up in St Peter’s and St Joseph’s.  We always follow a simple but meaningful format, and the prayer time usually lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Both groups meet on the first Wednesday of the month.  Please come to St. Joseph’s altar of Our Lady at 6.00pm or Our Lady Star of the Sea parish centre at 7.00pm. Additionally when not meeting in person there are weekly prayer sessions at 7.00pm on a Wednesday “online” using  Zoom. If you would like to know more about this comforting, supportive and joyful group, come and pray with us or talk to Emma Cox, Pauline Elston or Wanda Kruszynska. And if any fathers would like to pray together, there is a ‘Fathers Prayers’ movement too so perhaps you may wish to start one in Lytham St. Annes. Wanda Kruszynska.
